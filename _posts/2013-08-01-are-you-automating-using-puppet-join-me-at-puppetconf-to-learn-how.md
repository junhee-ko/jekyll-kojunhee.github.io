### What is PuppetConf?

I think it is best to start with what is Puppet. In short and simple terms, Puppet is a tool used by System, Applications, and Network administrators to automate tasks of IT Operations.

PuppetConf is a place where all types can come and learn about the following

  * Continuous Delivery
  * Case Studies of people using Puppet
  * DevOps
  * Cloud Automation
  * Getting Started with Puppet

I&#8217;ll be at PuppetConf in San Francisco August 22-23rd. I hope you will too.

To that end, the fine folks at Puppet have provided a $200 dollar discount off the registration fee to anyone who reads my blog using the [**discount code: colinmcnamara**][2]
