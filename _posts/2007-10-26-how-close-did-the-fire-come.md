On google maps, it shows that the fire came withing two thousand feet of our place. It circled us on three sides, basically surrounding the valley. I took a screenshot from one of the news sites for everyone. The little red houses are homes that did not make it. The neighborhood to the right (just over the hill is rancho bernardo).
