## Initialization

- Initialization is the process of preparing an instance of a class, structure, or enumeration for use. - This process involves setting an initial value for each stored property on that instance 
- and performing any other setup or initialization that is required before the new instance is ready for use.
- You implement this initialization process by defining initializers, 
- which are like special methods that can be called to create a new instance of a particular type. 
- Unlike Objective-C initializers, Swift initializers do not return a value. 
- Their primary role is to ensure that new instances of a type are correctly initialized before they are used for the first time.

```
struct Fahrenheit {
    var temperature: Double
    init() {
        temperature = 32.0
    }
}
var f = Fahrenheit()
print("The default temperature is \(f.temperature)° Fahrenheit")
// Prints "The default temperature is 32.0° Fahrenheit"
```

## Deinitialization

- A deinitializer is called immediately before a class instance is deallocated. 
- You write deinitializers with the deinit keyword, 
- similar to how initializers are written with the init keyword. 
- Deinitializers are only available on class types.

```
class Player {
    var coinsInPurse: Int
    init(coins: Int) {
        coinsInPurse = Bank.distribute(coins: coins)
    }
    func win(coins: Int) {
        coinsInPurse += Bank.distribute(coins: coins)
    }
    deinit {
        Bank.receive(coins: coinsInPurse)
    }
}
```
