Expect something really big in the cloud computing / datacenter 3.0 space to be announced by Cisco this afternoon.

Sadly, I have the unfortunate situation of being tagged as an insider (work in the partner community). So I have to play nice, and cannot reveal any juicy tidbits. Suffice it to say, that Jashree Ullal and Doug Gourlay weren&#8217;t pulling anyones leg in the past two years when the DataCenter 3.0 vision was established.

Stay Tuned
