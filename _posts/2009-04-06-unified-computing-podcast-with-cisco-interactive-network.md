I had the pleasure of being invited to Cisco&#8217;s Interactive Network podcast last week with hosted by Robb Boyd and Jimmy Ray Purser.

Brian Schwarz (SAVBU) and I were guests, and had the chance to talk about Cisco&#8217;s Unified Computing offering. It was my first time doing a podcast, and I have to say it was a blast.

If you can spare the time, I recommend you check out it &#8211;
