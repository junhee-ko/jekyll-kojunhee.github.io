            The board has served multiple key purposes, but fundementally a seperate group of individuals focused on all the items that surround, but are no technical direction of OpenStack has been key to the projects success<em><strong>. </strong></em>The ability to create and sustain a successful govenernance model has been key to the success of the growth and success of the project so far.

          What do you think the top priority of the Board should be in 2014?

      <div>
        <p>
          Last time I checked, 92% of contributions to OpenStack are from corporate contributors. As we grow and marture as a project, I believe that we have to increase the individual and educational contributions to OpenStack. The board has a key role in achieving this goal.
