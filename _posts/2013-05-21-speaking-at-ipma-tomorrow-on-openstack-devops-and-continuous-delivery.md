I&#8217;m hopping on a plane to Seattle this afternoon to speak at 2013 IPMA Forum at Saint Martin&#8217;s University.

I&#8217;ll be continuing my habit of tilting at windmills (ask [@jdooley_clt][1] if you are curious), with the goal of getting state and local agencies to adopt modern software development methodologies (Agile) on OpenSource platforms such as OpenStack.

## How can you get hold of me while I&#8217;m out here

The best way of getting hold of me while I&#8217;m at a conference is pinging me on twitter &#8211; [@colinmcnamara][2] or swing by the Nexus booth on the show floor and ask someone to hunt me me down.
