- Access control restricts access to parts of your code from code in other source files and modules.
- This feature enables you to hide the implementation details of your code, and to specify a preferred interface through which that code can be accessed and used.

- You can assign specific access levels to individual types (classes, structures, and enumerations), 
- as well as to properties, methods, initializers, and subscripts belonging to those types. 
- Protocols can be restricted to a certain context, as can global constants, variables, and functions.

- In addition to offering various levels of access control, Swift reduces the need to specify explicit access control levels by providing default access levels for typical scenarios. 
- Indeed, if you are writing a single-target app, you may not need to specify explicit access control levels at all.

```
public class SomePublicClass {}
internal class SomeInternalClass {}
fileprivate class SomeFilePrivateClass {}
private class SomePrivateClass {}
 
public var somePublicVariable = 0
internal let someInternalConstant = 0
fileprivate func someFilePrivateFunction() {}
private func somePrivateFunction() {}
```

- Unless otherwise specified, the default access level is internal, 
- This means that 
- SomeInternalClass and someInternalConstant can be written without an explicit access-level modifier,
- and will still have an access level of internal:

```
class SomeInternalClass {}              // implicitly internal
let someInternalConstant = 0            // implicitly internal
```
