# Type Safety and Type Inference

- A type safe language encourages you to be clear about the types of values your code can work with. 
- If part of your code requires a String, you can‚Äôt pass it an Int by mistake.
- If you don‚Äôt specify the type of value you need, Swift uses type inference to work out the appropriate type
- Type inference enables a compiler to deduce the type of a particular expression automatically when it compiles your code, simply by examining the values you provide.

	```
	let meaningOfLife = 42
	// meaningOfLife is inferred to be of type Int
	
	let pi = 3.14159
	// pi is inferred to be of type Double
	
	let anotherPi = 3 + 0.14159
	// anotherPi is also inferred to be of type Double
	```
	
# Type Aliases

- Type aliases define an alternative name for an existing type. 

	```
	typealias AudioSample = UInt16
	var maxAmplitudeFound = AudioSample.min
	// maxAmplitudeFound is now 0
	```
	
# tuples 

- Tuples group multiple values into a single compound value
- Tuples are useful for temporary groups of related values.

	```
	let http404Error = (404, "Not Found")
	// http404Error is of type (Int, String), and equals (404, "Not Found")
		
	let (statusCode, statusMessage) = http404Error
	print("The status code is \(statusCode)")
	// Prints "The status code is 404"
	print("The status message is \(statusMessage)")
	// Prints "The status message is Not Found"
	
	let (justTheStatusCode, _) = http404Error
	print("The status code is \(justTheStatusCode)")
	// Prints "The status code is 404"
	
	print("The status code is \(http404Error.0)")
	// Prints "The status code is 404"
	print("The status message is \(http404Error.1)")
	// Prints "The status message is Not Found"
	```
	
	```
	let http200Status = (statusCode: 200, description: "OK")
	print("The status code is \(http200Status.statusCode)")
	// Prints "The status code is 200"
	print("The status message is \(http200Status.description)")
	// Prints "The status message is OK"
	```
	
# Collection Types

- Arrays are ordered collections of values. 
- Sets are unordered collections of unique values. 
- Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations.

	![img](https://github.com/KoJunHee/kojunhee.github.io/raw/master/img/collection.png)
	
- Mutability of Collections

	- If you create an array, a set, or a dictionary, and assign it to a variable, the collection that is created will be mutable. 
	- If you assign an array, a set, or a dictionary to a constant, that collection is immutable, and its size and contents cannot be changed.


### Arrays

- Creating an Empty Array

	```
	var someInts = [Int]()
	print("someInts is of type [Int] with \(someInts.count) items.")
	// Prints "someInts is of type [Int] with 0 items."
	
	someInts.append(3)
	// someInts now contains 1 value of type Int
	someInts = []
	// someInts is now an empty array, but is still of type [Int]
	```
	
- Creating an Array with a Default Value

	```
	var threeDoubles = Array(repeating: 0.0, count: 3)
	// threeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
	```

- Creating an Array by Adding Two Arrays Together

	```
	var anotherThreeDoubles = Array(repeating: 2.5, count: 3)
	// anotherThreeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [2.5, 2.5, 2.5]
 
	var sixDoubles = threeDoubles + anotherThreeDoubles
	// sixDoubles is inferred as [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5]
	```

- Creating an Array with an Array Literal

	```
	var shoppingList: [String] = ["Eggs", "Milk"]
	// shoppingList has been initialized with two initial items
	```

- Accessing and Modifying an Array

	```
	print("The shopping list contains \(shoppingList.count) items.")
	// Prints "The shopping list contains 2 items."
	
	if shoppingList.isEmpty {
    print("The shopping list is empty.")
	} else {
    print("The shopping list is not empty.")
	}
	// Prints "The shopping list is not empty."
	
	shoppingList.append("Flour")
	// shoppingList now contains 3 items, and someone is making pancakes

	shoppingList += ["Baking Powder"]
	// shoppingList now contains 4 items
	shoppingList += ["Chocolate Spread", "Cheese", "Butter"]
	// shoppingList now contains 7 items
	
	var firstItem = shoppingList[0]
	// firstItem is equal to "Eggs"
	
	shoppingList[0] = "Six eggs"
	// the first item in the list is now equal to "Six eggs" rather than "Eggs"
	
	shoppingList[4...6] = ["Bananas", "Apples"]
	// shoppingList now contains 6 items
	
	shoppingList.insert("Maple Syrup", at: 0)
	// shoppingList now contains 7 items
	// "Maple Syrup" is now the first item in the list
	
	let mapleSyrup = shoppingList.remove(at: 0)
	// the item that was at index 0 has just been removed
	// shoppingList now contains 6 items, and no Maple Syrup
	// the mapleSyrup constant is now equal to the removed "Maple Syrup" string
	
	firstItem = shoppingList[0]
	// firstItem is now equal to "Six eggs"
	
	let apples = shoppingList.removeLast()
	// the last item in the array has just been removed
	// shoppingList now contains 5 items, and no apples
	// the apples constant is now equal to the removed "Apples" string
	```
	
- Iterating Over an Array

	```
	for item in shoppingList {
    print(item)
	}
	// Six eggs
	// Milk
	// Flour
	// Baking Powder
	// Bananas
	
	for (index, value) in shoppingList.enumerated() {
    print("Item \(index + 1): \(value)")
	}
	// Item 1: Six eggs
	// Item 2: Milk
	// Item 3: Flour
	// Item 4: Baking Powder
	// Item 5: Bananas
	```
	
### Sets

- Hash Values for Set Types

	- A type must be hashable in order to be stored in a set
	- that is, the type must provide a way to compute a hash value for itself

- Creating and Initializing an Empty Set

	```
	var letters = Set<Character>()
	print("letters is of type Set<Character> with \(letters.count) items.")
	// Prints "letters is of type Set<Character> with 0 items."


	letters.insert("a")
	// letters now contains 1 value of type Character
	letters = []
	// letters is now an empty set, but is still of type Set<Character>
	```
	
- Creating a Set with an Array Literal

	```
	var favoriteGenres: Set<String> = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]
	// favoriteGenres has been initialized with three initial items
	
	var favoriteGenres: Set = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]
	// Because all values in the array literal are of the same type, Swift can infer that Set<String> is the correct type to use for the favoriteGenres variable.
	```
- Accessing and Modifying a Set

	```
	print("I have \(favoriteGenres.count) favorite music genres.")
	// Prints "I have 3 favorite music genres."
	
	if favoriteGenres.isEmpty {
	    print("As far as music goes, I'm not picky.")
	} else {
	    print("I have particular music preferences.")
	}
	// Prints "I have particular music preferences."
	
	favoriteGenres.insert("Jazz")
	// favoriteGenres now contains 4 items
	
	if let removedGenre = favoriteGenres.remove("Rock") {
    print("\(removedGenre)? I'm over it.")
	} else {
	    print("I never much cared for that.")
	}
	// Prints "Rock? I'm over it."	
	
	if favoriteGenres.contains("Funk") {
    print("I get up on the good foot.")
	} else {
	    print("It's too funky in here.")
	}
	// Prints "It's too funky in here."
	```

- Iterating Over a Set

	```
	for genre in favoriteGenres {
    print("\(genre)")
	}
	// Jazz
	// Hip hop
	// Classical
	
	for genre in favoriteGenres.sorted() {
    print("\(genre)")
	}
	// Classical
	// Hip hop
	// Jazz
	```
- Fundamental Set Operations

	![img](https://github.com/KoJunHee/kojunhee.github.io/raw/master/img/SetOperations.png)
	
	```
 	let oddDigits: Set = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
	let evenDigits: Set = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
	let singleDigitPrimeNumbers: Set = [2, 3, 5, 7]
	 
	oddDigits.union(evenDigits).sorted()
	// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] 
	oddDigits.intersection(evenDigits).sorted()
	// []
	oddDigits.subtracting(singleDigitPrimeNumbers).sorted()
	// [1, 9]
	oddDigits.symmetricDifference(singleDigitPrimeNumbers).sorted()
	// [1, 2, 9]
	```
	
	```
	let houseAnimals: Set = ["üê∂", "üê±"]
	let farmAnimals: Set = ["üêÆ", "üêî", "üêë", "üê∂", "üê±"]
	let cityAnimals: Set = ["üê¶", "üê≠"]
	 
	houseAnimals.isSubset(of: farmAnimals)
	// true
	farmAnimals.isSuperset(of: houseAnimals)
	// true
	farmAnimals.isDisjoint(with: cityAnimals)
	// true
	```

### Dictionaries

- Creating an Empty Dictionary

	```
	var namesOfIntegers = [Int: String]()
	// namesOfIntegers is an empty [Int: String] dictionary
	// Its keys are of type Int, and its values are of type String.
	
	namesOfIntegers[16] = "sixteen"
	// namesOfIntegers now contains 1 key-value pair
	namesOfIntegers = [:]
	// namesOfIntegers is once again an empty dictionary of type [Int: String]
	```
- Creating a Dictionary with a Dictionary Literal

	```
	var airports: [String: String] = ["YYZ": "Toronto Pearson", "DUB": "Dublin"]
	
	var airports = ["YYZ": "Toronto Pearson", "DUB": "Dublin"]	//type inference
	```
- Accessing and Modifying a Dictionary

	```
	print("The airports dictionary contains \(airports.count) items.")
	// Prints "The airports dictionary contains 2 items."
	
	if airports.isEmpty {
    print("The airports dictionary is empty.")
	} else {
	    print("The airports dictionary is not empty.")
	}
	// Prints "The airports dictionary is not empty."
	
	airports["LHR"] = "London"
	// the airports dictionary now contains 3 items
	
	airports["LHR"] = "London Heathrow"
	// the value for "LHR" has been changed to "London Heathrow"
	
	if let oldValue = airports.updateValue("Dublin Airport", forKey: "DUB") {
   	 	print("The old value for DUB was \(oldValue).")
	}
	// Prints "The old value for DUB was Dublin."
	
	if let airportName = airports["DUB"] {
	    print("The name of the airport is \(airportName).")
	} else {
	    print("That airport is not in the airports dictionary.")
	}
	// Prints "The name of the airport is Dublin Airport."
	
	airports["APL"] = "Apple International"
	// "Apple International" is not the real airport for APL, so delete it
	airports["APL"] = nil
	// APL has now been removed from the dictionary
	
	if let removedValue = airports.removeValue(forKey: "DUB") {
	    print("The removed airport's name is \(removedValue).")
	} else {
	    print("The airports dictionary does not contain a value for DUB.")
	}
	// Prints "The removed airport's name is Dublin Airport."
	```

- Iterating Over a Dictionary

	```
	for (airportCode, airportName) in airports {
	    print("\(airportCode): \(airportName)")
	}
	// YYZ: Toronto Pearson
	// LHR: London Heathrow
	
	for airportCode in airports.keys {
	    print("Airport code: \(airportCode)")
	}
	// Airport code: YYZ
	// Airport code: LHR
	 
	for airportName in airports.values {
	    print("Airport name: \(airportName)")
	}
	// Airport name: Toronto Pearson
	// Airport name: London Heathrow
	
	let airportCodes = [String](airports.keys)
	// airportCodes is ["YYZ", "LHR"]
	 
	let airportNames = [String](airports.values)
	// airportNames is ["Toronto Pearson", "London Heathrow"]
	```
	
# Enumerations

- Enumeration Syntax
	
	```
	enum CompassPoint {
		case north
		case south
		case east
		case west
	}
	
	enum Planet {
		 case mercury, venus, earth, mars, jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptune
	}
		
	var directionToHead = CompassPoint.west
	directionToHead = .east
	```
	

- Matching Enumeration Values with a Switch Statement

	```
	directionToHead = .south
	switch directionToHead {
	case .north:
	    print("Lots of planets have a north")
	case .south:
	    print("Watch out for penguins")
	case .east:
	    print("Where the sun rises")
	case .west:
	    print("Where the skies are blue")
	}
	// Prints "Watch out for penguins"
	
	let somePlanet = Planet.earth
	switch somePlanet {
	case .earth:
	    print("Mostly harmless")
	default:
	    print("Not a safe place for humans")
	}
	// Prints "Mostly harmless"
	```
