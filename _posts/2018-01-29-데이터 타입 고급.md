# Type Safety and Type Inference

- A type safe language encourages you to be clear about the types of values your code can work with. 
- If part of your code requires a String, you can’t pass it an Int by mistake.
- If you don’t specify the type of value you need, Swift uses type inference to work out the appropriate type
- Type inference enables a compiler to deduce the type of a particular expression automatically when it compiles your code, simply by examining the values you provide.

	```
	let meaningOfLife = 42
	// meaningOfLife is inferred to be of type Int
	
	let pi = 3.14159
	// pi is inferred to be of type Double
	
	let anotherPi = 3 + 0.14159
	// anotherPi is also inferred to be of type Double
	```
	
# Type Aliases

- Type aliases define an alternative name for an existing type. 

	```
	typealias AudioSample = UInt16
	var maxAmplitudeFound = AudioSample.min
	// maxAmplitudeFound is now 0
	```
	
# tuples 

- Tuples group multiple values into a single compound value
- Tuples are useful for temporary groups of related values.

	```
	let http404Error = (404, "Not Found")
	// http404Error is of type (Int, String), and equals (404, "Not Found")
		
	let (statusCode, statusMessage) = http404Error
	print("The status code is \(statusCode)")
	// Prints "The status code is 404"
	print("The status message is \(statusMessage)")
	// Prints "The status message is Not Found"
	
	let (justTheStatusCode, _) = http404Error
	print("The status code is \(justTheStatusCode)")
	// Prints "The status code is 404"
	
	print("The status code is \(http404Error.0)")
	// Prints "The status code is 404"
	print("The status message is \(http404Error.1)")
	// Prints "The status message is Not Found"
	```
	
	```
	let http200Status = (statusCode: 200, description: "OK")
	print("The status code is \(http200Status.statusCode)")
	// Prints "The status code is 200"
	print("The status message is \(http200Status.description)")
	// Prints "The status message is OK"
	```
	
# Collection Types

- Arrays are ordered collections of values. 
- Sets are unordered collections of unique values. 
- Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations.

- Mutability of Collections

	- If you create an array, a set, or a dictionary, and assign it to a variable, the collection that is created will be mutable. 
	- If you assign an array, a set, or a dictionary to a constant, that collection is immutable, and its size and contents cannot be changed.


### Arrays

- Creating an Empty Array

	```
	var someInts = [Int]()
	print("someInts is of type [Int] with \(someInts.count) items.")
	// Prints "someInts is of type [Int] with 0 items."
	
	someInts.append(3)
	// someInts now contains 1 value of type Int
	someInts = []
	// someInts is now an empty array, but is still of type [Int]
	```
	
- Creating an Array with a Default Value

	```
	var threeDoubles = Array(repeating: 0.0, count: 3)
	// threeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
	```

- Creating an Array by Adding Two Arrays Together

	```
	var anotherThreeDoubles = Array(repeating: 2.5, count: 3)
	// anotherThreeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [2.5, 2.5, 2.5]
 
	var sixDoubles = threeDoubles + anotherThreeDoubles
	// sixDoubles is inferred as [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5]
	```

- Creating an Array with an Array Literal

	```
	var shoppingList: [String] = ["Eggs", "Milk"]
	// shoppingList has been initialized with two initial items
	```
