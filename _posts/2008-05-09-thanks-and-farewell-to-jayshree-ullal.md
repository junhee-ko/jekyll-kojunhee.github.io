Jayshree Ullal anounced today that she will be leaving her post as Senior Vice President in charge of Data Center, Switching, and Security groups. Jayshree has earned a reputation inside and outside of Cisco as a person who could take charge and get things done. First coming to Cisco as an engineer with the crescendo acquisition, she has directed some of Cisco&#8217;s most successful units culminating with the realization of the DC 3.0 vision.

Please join me in thanking Jayshree for all the positive contributions she has given to Cisco and the industry, and wishing her the best in her future endeavors.
