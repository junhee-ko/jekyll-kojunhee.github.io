What I would like to share today is a video guide on how to properly create a Unified Computing System (UCS)Â  Bill of Materials (BOM), and how to route that BOM into the appropriate ordering system.

You may notice that I am using a tool called Netformx. You may ask &#8211; since this is a Cisco product, why aren&#8217;t we using the Dynamic Configuration Tool or the MultiLine Configurator? The answer that was given to me was that UCS requires a bottom up configuration. It requires that you start with the type and number of systems, and then work your way up to the amount of Chassis, FEX&#8217;s, links and Fabric Interconnects that are required. All of the workflows in Cisco&#8217;s existing tools require a top down approach. Until the new configuration workspace is released from Cisco, Netformx is your only option to quote any UCS product.
