Cool new features in 12.2(33)SXH

Hell has frozen over, you now no longer need to explicitly configure peers in a BGP configuration. You now can set up peer group templates that allow connections from a range of ip address&#8217;s. This has a multitude of implications. The main scenarios that I can think of are &#8211;

1. dynamic configuration of peers in a fully bgp enabled datacenter (replacement for eigrp / ospf)  
2. dynamic advertisement of host routes from servers

Other cool things include tracking of SSO status in hsrp / glbp groups and an embeded syslog manager which allows you to have full filtering capability on device without needing an external server. I see this will be great for troubleshooting.
