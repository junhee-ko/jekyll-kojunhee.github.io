At this years VMworld (2013) in San Francisco I had the pleasure of recording a couple video&#8217;s. The first video that got recorded was for #vBrownBag. The topic I decided to cover was a Primer on OpenStack for VMware admins. In this short 10 minute video I cover the key drivers and applications that use OpenStack vs VMware, as well as a comparison of the technical components of OpenStack in terms a VMware administrator would be used to.
