## Naming Constants and Variables

- can contain almost any character, including Unicode characters
 
- can’t contain 
	- whitespace characters, 
	- mathematical symbols, 
	- arrows, 
	- private-use (or invalid) Unicode code points,
	- or line- and box-drawing characters.
	 
- can't begin with a number

- Once you’ve declared a constant or variable of a certain type, 
	- you can’t declare it again with the same name, 
	- or change it to store values of a different type. 
	- can't change a constant into a variable or a variable into a constant.

- can change the value of an existing variable to another value of a compatible type

	``` 
	var friendlyWelcome = "Hello!"
	friendlyWelcome = "Bonjour!"
	```
	
- the value of a constant can’t be changed after it’s set.

	```
	let languageName = "Swift"
	languageName = "Swift++"
	// This is a compile-time error: languageName cannot be changed.
	```

## Printing Constants and Variables

- print(_:separator:terminator:) 

	- The separator and terminator parameter have default values,
	- so you can omit them when you call this function

- string interpolation

	```
	print("The current value of friendlyWelcome is \(friendlyWelcome)")
	```
	
	- result => The current value of friendlyWelcome is Bonjour!

## Comments

- // this is comment
- /* this is comment */


## Semicolons

- doesn’t require you to write a semicolon (;)
