- Intent

  - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
  - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

- Bad Example

  - the manager class which is a high level class, and the low level class called Worker
  - now we have to change Manager class in order to introduce the new SuperWorker
    - Adding a new protocol will create the need to add code for parsing and serializing the content for each type of field.
    - Adding a new content type (like html) make us to add code for each protocol implemented.

- Good Example

  - Manager class doesn't require changes when adding SuperWorkers.
