News just in, Cisco has aquired Nuova systems. They have a distributed computing and storage platform very similar to plan 9.  
[News Release ][1]

This news is interesting as it shows that Cisco is continuing their push into the application layer.  
Its Application Oriented Networking blade directly competes with IBM. The content services switch competes with Sun, F5, Juniper and Netscaler. If Cisco can bring a distributed backend to the market that integrates smoothly with the middleware solutions they are currently proposing it will be unstopable. Anybody care to jump on this bandwagon?
