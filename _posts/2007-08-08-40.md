The emergence of MDS features in Cisco&#8217;s datacenter networking equipment

For those that have been watching, there has been a trend of helpful MDS (Cisco&#8217;s director class storage switch) features into core networking products. The first feature I have noticed is the &#8220;do&#8221; command now available in configuraiton mode in ios 12.4. It allows you to execute exec commands from the configuration section in IOS. Needless to say this is very handy, primarily due to not having to exit to your shell to do a show command.

Things like that make me very happy. They decrease the time needed complete tasks, and improve your accuracy.

One of the features that I have always loved with the MDS is call home. It is a deamon that monitors the hardware and software for faults, and when one is found it posts an email to TAC and your support staff.

This feature now has made it into the 6500 series switches as of 12.2(22)SXH which should be out mid August. It will integrate directly with Cisco TAC, and your own internal Monitoring and management systems. The really cool thing is that this ties right into the GOLD (Generic On Line Diagnostics) tests. If your GOLD tests find a hardware problem TAC will automatically be contacted, a RMA issued, engineer contacted, and parts shipped to the devices location. The target for this is SmartNet time + 1.5 hours. So if you had 4 hour smartnet, you could expect hardware onsite, with no additional troubleshooting in 5.5 hours.
