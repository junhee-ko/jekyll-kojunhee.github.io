This volunteer-driven charity funds more in childhood cancer research grants than any organization except the U. S. government.

This year I was able to not only involve myself and my friends in this charity, but I was also supported by the owners of Nexus who sponsored the bar tab at the Irvine St. Baldrick&#8217;s event.

I want to not only thank everyone who supported this great charity, but of course invite anyone else who is passionate about supporting cancer research to join in the fight and donate through my participant page linked below.
