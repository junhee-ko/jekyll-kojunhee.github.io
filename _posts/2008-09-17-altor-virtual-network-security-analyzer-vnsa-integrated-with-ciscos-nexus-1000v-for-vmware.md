Altor networks is the first vendor to announce that it will be leveraging the additional visibility and security features of Cisco&#8217;s Nexus 1000v virtual switch for VMware. Their Virtual Network Security Analyzer and Virtual Network Firewall products are targeted at the emerging virtual machine security markets.

Altor networks goal is to provide a single pane view of communications within your ESX clusters, as well as ease access control list creation and deployment. With this single pane virtualization customers should be able to decrease the time needed resolve availability and security issues, allowing virtual enviornments to continue to scale.

This is a sign that we can look forward to many other software vendors adding Nexus 1000vÂ  support to their existing product lines. I wonder who is next ? NetQOS maybe &#8230;.
