What should I do this thanksgiving break?  
<br style="font-weight: bold" /><span style="font-weight: bold"> 1. Write a host auditing application</span>  
<span style="font-weight: bold"><br /> Existing Features &#8211;</span>  
Generates XML configs based on specific command generation  
Outputs to flat XML database  
<span style="font-weight: bold">New Features &#8211;</span>  
Runs from central monitoring platform  
Gathers host information first by shelling into boxes and gathering packages / processes  
Verifies application application by NMAP of high number ports  
Outputs into individual HTTP / XML formatted files  
Creates index for easy host data access  
Could run locally to create a host status page  
Create nagios byhost config on output  
Should I output through Apache, or a servlet&#8230;  
<span style="font-weight: bold">Thoughts</span>  
This could go over really well  
Would be fun to write  
Could land me in scope creep hell

<span style="font-weight: bold"> 2. Update the Real Time System config generator</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold"> Existing Features-</span>  
Generates Content Switching configs from application data  
Has a web interface for development access  
Notifies help desk  
<span style="font-weight: bold">New Features &#8211;</span>  
Create firewall definition files  
Create nagios probe config  
Integrate XML submission probe generation  
<span style="font-weight: bold">Thoughts</span>  
Nice to have, but 90% of the functionality is already there

<span style="font-weight: bold"> 3. Update Nagios system config generator (nagiosuploader)</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold">Existing Features- </span>  
Grabs system info when run locally  
Posts configs to monitoring server for processing  
<span style="font-weight: bold"> New features</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /> Host auditing to determine services monitored  
Clean up error condition handling  
Web interface for config generation  
<span style="font-weight: bold"> Thoughts</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /> Having a web interface for users to fill out would lower my workload

<span style="font-weight: bold">4. Automate web application error reporting</span><br style="font-weight: bold" />  
<span style="font-weight: bold"> Existing features &#8211;</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /> None, well.. manually executed text processing on log files. I wouldn&#8217;t call that an application  
<span style="font-weight: bold"> New features &#8211;</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /> Automation of customer / error code matrix grep statements  
Output in XML / http format web page and email  
Text only output in commented form <&#8211; text &#8211;> for command line mail clients  
<span style="font-weight: bold"> Thoughts &#8211;</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /> Proves the point that certain people can be replaced by very small shell scripts (Unix humor)  
Should be a big with with Client services  
Could drive the application &#8220;digital dashboard&#8221;  
Should be a fun to practice using AWK for formatting data in a standard output  
Serious danger of scope creep  
May be better implemented in a MySQL back-end

<span style="font-weight: bold">5. Do some personal growth items</span><br style="font-weight: bold" />  
Finish the Vmware image for the 7206 emulator and post to Vmware Technology Network for general use (delete IOS files before uploading)  
Read some more of Long&#8217;s storage book  
Write a sample chapter for Stay at Home Photography  
Get GTK pod to run under my cmcnamar account, not root (I think the IPOD&#8217;s file system doesn&#8217;t like changing ownership or file attributes)  
Redo the 2cups homepage  
Clean the Garage&#8230;&#8230;..
