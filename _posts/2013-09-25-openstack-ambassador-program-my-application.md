<p style="font-family: Arial;">
  <span style="font-family: Arial;">Just over a month ago, the OpenStack Foundation announced the OpenStack Ambassador Program. The aim of this program is to create a framework of community leaders to sustainably expand the reach of OpenStack around the world.</span>

  While filling out the application, I realized that I was a bit more active over the past couple years then I have realized. I also figured, that this is something I should share on my blog, as social media is one of the key assets that I can bring to the program.

  <span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Below is my application to the program &#8211;  </strong></span>

  Q: Why are you applying to be an OpenStack Ambassador ?
</h3>

<div style="font-family: Arial;">
  I want to increase my impact on the community by lowering barriers to adoption and increasing contribution to OpenStack.I feel there is a parallel with my OpenStack experience to my experiences with Linux in the 90&#8217;s. Back then I found a platform that changed how I ran my ISP. But I wasn&#8217;t able to really get it going until I we started organizing into groups in the community and started lowering the barriers to entry as a community.I feel that I can use the lessons learned then and since to increase Visibility, Adoption and Contribution to OpenStack.

<h3 style="font-family: Arial;">
  Q: How have you participated in the OpenStack community to date ?
</h3>

  * I am an OpenStack ATC, with contributions to Folsom, Grizzly and Havana though I feel my most impactful contributions have been in the community not the code base.
  * <span style="font-family: Arial;">I am active in SFbay OpenStack meetup group that Sean Roberts leads. </span>
  * <span style="font-family: Arial;">I have helped three OpenStack meetup groups get off the ground (Denver, Minneapolis, and RTP) and am in progress of getting a fourth one started in Alpharetta. </span>
  * <span style="font-family: Arial;">In two of those groups, Denver and Minn, I have flown out to give the initial talk for the kickoff meetup. </span>
  * <span style="font-family: Arial;">I developed and delivered multiple OpenStack presentation decks educating and enabling the community. Including &#8220;Surviving your first commit&#8221; which was delivered at the San Diego summit (and many users groups and events) and most recently &#8220;OpenStack for VMware admins&#8221; delivered at the #vBrownBag hall at VMworld San Francisco. </span>
  * <span style="font-family: Arial;">I&#8217;ve helped multiple storage Vendors understand the why and how to develop and release integrations into Cinder. </span>
  * <span style="font-family: Arial;">Sean Roberts and I are the founding members of the training-manuals blueprint in OpenStack-Manuals. I have been focused on increasing core and community members, getting the CI system integrated, and ScrumBan (Project Management) </span>
  * <span style="font-family: Arial;">I&#8217;ve increased visibility and understanding of OpenStack through social media and my blog &#8211; </span><a style="font-family: Arial;" href="http://www.colinmcnamara.com/">www.colinmcnamara.com</a>
  * <span style="font-family: Arial;">I&#8217;ve volunteered at the OpenStack booth at multiple conferences. </span>
  * I co-chaired the Strategy Track for the upcoming OpenStack Summit in Hong Kong
  * <span style="font-family: Arial;">Most importantly of all, I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of helping others join the community and get their first contribution in to OpenStack. </span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span>

<h3 style="font-family: Arial;">
  Q: What ideas do you have for your community that you haven&#8217;t had time or resources to implement ?
</h3>

<div style="font-family: Arial;">
</div>

  * Holding consistent community delivered OpenStack training, lowering barriers to adoption of and contribution to OpenStack while increasing the pool of qualified engineers and developers.
  * Extending this same concept to intellectually gifted but economically disadvantaged individuals and regions around the world.
  * Spreading the word (separated from corporate FUD and occasional instances) about how to participate, extend, and replicate successful items that we are doing in the OpenStack community today.
  * Formalizing a support and mentoring program for getting OpenStack meetups started in new communities.

<h3 style="font-family: Arial;">
  Q: How will you work with others to achieve your goals?

  I feel the best way to impact a community is to spark and fan flames. I want to continue and increase this.How i will do this is best demonstrated by how and what i have been doing.
