      I first got involved with OpenStack late last year as part of a cloud platform evaluation process, with the goal of bringing back certain workloads from Amazon. Over the course of 2011 and through 2012 I have been accelerating my involvement including

    <h4>
      Describe your experience with other non profits or serving as a board member. How does your experience prepare you for the role of a board member?

  <div>
    <p>
      My experience in other non profits has been primarily been in driving awareness and participation to certain charitable causes such as Wounded Warriors, Valley Food Bank, and others.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Board member experience includes a few technical adivsory boards and CTO boards.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Relevant experiences in both of those include ensuring balanced view points from all members, as well as advocacy for user communities (my perspect is weighted to more Ops then Dev).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My experience running a 90+ million dollar line of business in a past role also allows me to contribute in both advocacy for users of OpenStack, but also help in raising funds and awareness.

        What do you see as the Board&#8217;s role in OpenStack&#8217;s success?

        The OpenStack board has to manage the balance between the Development Community that has added so much value to the project, with the corporate interests who are now both involved, and also commiting development resources. This all has to be balanced out with the eye on providing the best product for the community as a whole.

    <h4>
      What do you think the top priority of the Board should be in 2013?
    </h4>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    A
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <p>
      I think the top priority for the board should be establishing a tempo of tone of collaboration between all parties participating. Whether they are manufacture, developer, or user. This will the foundation going down the rat hole of posturing and stalling that IETF has become.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If this is accomplished, I am positive that OpenStack will become the dominant Open Source cloud platform in the industry.
