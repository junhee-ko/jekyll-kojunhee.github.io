One of the best parts of my job is that I get to meet new people almost ever day. Many of them have interesting ways of blowing off steam. Some build race cars, others build fish tanks, others like me enjoy photography. Josh Carley IT Director at a local Casino tops us all, he is the lead singer for a local San Diego rock band called <a href="http://www.fmrevolver.com/" title="FM Revolver" target="_blank">FM Revolver</a>. They headlined Saturday night at the Brick by Brick, putting on an amazing show. I was lucky enough be invited, and be allowed to shoot. Check out some of the pictures I took that night &#8211;
