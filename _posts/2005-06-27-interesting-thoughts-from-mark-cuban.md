So pretty much everybody knows Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Mavericks. I was reading his blog and came accross some quotes from him.

“When you sit at the business table you always look for the sucker or fool. If you don’t see one, it’s you.”

&#8220;you only have to win once in business&#8221;
