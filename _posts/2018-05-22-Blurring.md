## Blurring

- In blurring, we simple blur an image. 
- An image looks more sharp or more detailed if we are able to perceive all the objects and their shapes correctly in it. 
- For example. An image with a face, looks clear when we are able to identify eyes, ears, nose, lips, forehead e.t.c very clear. 
- This shape of an object is due to its edges. 
- So in blurring, we simple reduce the edge content and makes the transition form one color to the other very smooth.

## Blurring vs zooming

- You might have seen a blurred image when you zoom an image. 
  - When you zoom an image using pixel replication, and zooming factor is increased, you saw a blurred image. This image also has less details, but it is not true blurring.
- In zooming, you add new pixels to an image, that increase the overall number of pixels in an image, 
- In blurring, the number of pixels of a normal image and a blurred image remains the same.

## Common example of a blurred image

## Types of filters

- Blurring can be achieved by many ways. 
- The common type of filters that are used to perform blurring are.
  - Mean filter
  - Weighted average filter
  - Gaussian filter

## Mean filter

- Mean filter is also known as Box filter and average filter. 
- A mean filter has the following properties.
  - It must be odd ordered
  - The sum of all the elements should be 1
  - All the elements should be same
- If we follow this rule, then for a mask of 3x3. We get the following result.

- The blurring can be increased by increasing the size of the mask. 
- The more is the size of the mask, the more is the blurring. 
- Because with greater mask, greater number of pixels are catered and one smooth transition is defined.

## Weighted average filter

- In weighted average filter, 

- we gave more weight to the center value. 

- Due to which the contribution of center becomes more then the rest of the values. Due to weighted average filtering, we can actually control the blurring.

- Properties of the weighted average filter are.

  - It must be odd ordered
  - The sum of all the elements should be 1
  - The weight of center element should be more then all of the other elements

  - The two properties are satisfied which are (1 and 3). But the property 2 is not satisfied. So in order to satisfy that we will simple divide the whole filter by 10, or multiply it with 1/10.

- Filter02

  - Dividing factor = 18.
