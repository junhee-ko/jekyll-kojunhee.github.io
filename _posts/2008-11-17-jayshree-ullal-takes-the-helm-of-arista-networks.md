The speculation is over, Jayshree Ullal former Senior Vice President in charge of Data Center, Switching, and Security groups for Cisco Systems is now the CEO of [Arista Networks][1]. Why she made that change is best by her on her blog &#8211;

> It is truly my pleasure and honor to join Arista Networks as the President and CEO of the company. I have known founders, Andy Bechtolsheim and David Cheriton for a decade and worked with them closely during their Granite/Cisco days. To me, Arista is a symbol of an exciting, innovative silicon valley start-up company at the brink of pioneering new models for cloud networking.
> 
> After corporate life and managing multibillion dollars of business at Cisco Systems, you might ask why I chose Arista Networks? Three things really drew me here:
> 
>   1. A top-notch and talented team, with focus on best of breed products and innovative EOSâ„¢ (Extensible Operating System) technology.
>   2. Working with Andy Bechtolsheim, and our long-standing 20+ year professional kinship.
>   3. A truly unique opportunity in our industry to build and grow into a great company!

Inside of Cisco Jayshree proved herself as a leader that could get results. There was even speculation that she was tagged to be John Chambers eventual replacement. I have a feeling the same qualities that drove her success inside of Cisco will follow her as she explores this new opportunity.
