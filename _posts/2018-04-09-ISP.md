- Intent

  - Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they don't use.

- Bad Example

  - now some robots came in the company they work as well , but they don't eat so they don't need a launch break. 
  - One on side the new Robot class need to implement the IWorker interface because robots works. 
  - On the other side, they don't have to implement it because they don't eat.
  - now we have to change Manager class in order to introduce the new SuperWorker

- Good Example

  - new Robot class is no longer forced to implement the eat method.
  - if we need another functionality for the robot like recharging, 
  - we create another interface IRechargeble with a method recharge.
