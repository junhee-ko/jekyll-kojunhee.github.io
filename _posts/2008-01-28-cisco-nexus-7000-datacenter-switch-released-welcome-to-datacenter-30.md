Data Center 3.0 has arrived with Cisco&#8217;s Nexus 7000 Data Center switch. I hope I am not to sensational in saying this, but the Data Center as you know it has changed drastically.

[singlepic id="1" w="320" h="240" mode="" float="" ]

Highlights of the the Nexus 7000&#8217;s features are &#8211;

  * 15 Terrabit per second backplane
  * Support for 40 and 100 gig ports in the future
  * Seperate control and data planes
  * link layer encryption
  * front to back airflow (FINALLY available in a non NEBS chassis)
  * Lossless non blocking fabric (VOQ enabled)
  * Fibre Channel, Infinaband, and Ethernet blades in one unified platform
  * Cisco Data Center Network Manager (MDS Fabric Manager on steroids)
  * Virtual Device Contexts (Network Systems virtualization, the next level past VRF route tags)
