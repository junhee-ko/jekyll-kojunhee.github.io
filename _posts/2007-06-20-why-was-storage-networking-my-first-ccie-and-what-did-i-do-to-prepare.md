<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">I got a question on groupstudy about my background, and why I chose Storage as my first CCIE. It seems like a good idea to post it here also.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">My background is all over the place. It goes from running a small ISP <span style="color: #737373">when I was 18 to managing international CallManager clusters, to </span><span style="color: #737373">enterprise data center design and migrations. I swear that I have tech </span><span style="color: #737373">ADD. I see something new and I am like.. oooooh shiny, lets do a sniff </span><span style="color: #737373">and see how it works.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">I actually attempted the Route Switch lab twice in 2002 (still had token </span><span style="color: #737373">ring and dlsw still) but got activated for the war before I could get my </span><span style="color: #737373">number. I can tell you.. that sucked horribly.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">So, why did I choose to get my Storage CCIE first instead of finishing </span><span style="color: #737373">up my Route Switch first? Well, over the past couple years I have done a </span><span style="color: #737373">significant amount of IP storage (NFS, ISCSI, ATA over Ethernet, etc) </span><span style="color: #737373">including building my own IP storage heads based on linux. I had also </span><span style="color: #737373">done a little bit of fiber channel work. I felt that I had a significant </span><span style="color: #737373">advantage compared to most network engineers in the storage networking </span><span style="color: #737373">space. And, I think more importantly, the topics that I had to study </span><span style="color: #737373">were new and fresh. Whereas when I cracked open my Route Switch books.. </span><span style="color: #737373">I honestly wasn&#8217;t to excited about it at the time ( I think I was </span><span style="color: #737373">holding a grudge from my first attempts in 2002).</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">The partner e-learning central portion of Cisco has an Excellent lab </span><span style="color: #737373">access to labgear.net. It gives you 2 hour segments of time with 2 mds&#8217;s </span><span style="color: #737373">(both with IPS blades), 1 2 port jbod, and 2 2 port servers. They also </span><span style="color: #737373">have introductory tutorials for most major technology segments.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">I did all of those, along with the every E-learning class that was on </span><span style="color: #737373">PEC. I think the major ones were the Design, Support, and CASSI classes.</span><span style="color: #737373">I took that, sat for the design and support specialist exams, and took </span><span style="color: #737373">my written last December.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">After doing all that work, I was honestly 70% there. I took a little </span><span style="color: #737373">break for january and febuary (There was no open lab dates) and then </span><span style="color: #737373">started hitting the labs I think at the end of febuary.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">For the majority of my practice I used the labs available through PEC. I </span><span style="color: #737373">also was able to weasel my way into 8 hour sessions every sunday from </span><span style="color: #737373">our channel SE. (I owe him plenty of drinks at networkers this year) For </span><span style="color: #737373">those 8 hour sessions I had labs created to summarize the major </span><span style="color: #737373">technology areas and to be as evil as possible to myself.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">I had one attempt which didn&#8217;t work out as well as I would have liked. </span><span style="color: #737373">In RTP the lab starts at 7:15. This means if you are from the west coast </span><span style="color: #737373">like I am you will be getting up at 3:00 am in the morning for your lab. </span><span style="color: #737373">That royally kicked my but. I diverted from my attack plan and ended up</span><br /> <span style="color: #737373">running out of time. It was a classic example of letting the lab run </span><span style="color: #737373">you, instead of you running the lab.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">Luckily a data opened up just over a month later. I spent that time just</span><span style="color: #737373"> working on my speed (speed is the secret sauce). I migrated to using </span><span style="color: #737373">Fabric Manager (gui interface) instead of command line. After 2 practice </span><span style="color: #737373">runs my time had dropped 25%. I also flew out to RTP 3 days before, and </span><span style="color: #737373">made sure to relax and get on east coast time. </span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">For my final prep I got access to iementor&#8217;s lab. Their lab is </span><span style="color: #737373">excellent. I cannot reinforce enough how much it contributed to my </span><span style="color: #737373">confidence in that final week. Roman was really cool about working with </span><span style="color: #737373">an existing candidate to get me squeezed in. They are really cool guys, </span><span style="color: #737373">and they have the only workbook on the market right now.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">So, I used their lab 2 days before mine, and then just chilled the day </span><span style="color: #737373">before. The day of the lab I had 70 points by lunch, and had completed </span><span style="color: #737373">configuration of the lab by 12:30. I spent the rest of the day reviewing </span><span style="color: #737373">my configurations (found 2 errors), fixing one bug, and generally </span><span style="color: #737373">harassing the proctor to make sure I didn&#8217;t misinterpret anything.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">So.. if I had it all to do over again what would I do. </span><span style="color: #737373">I would still do the PEC stuff, and continue to primarily live in the </span><span style="color: #737373">Doc CD. Though I would probably pony up the cash and buy the iementor </span><span style="color: #737373">book and more lab time with them. </span></span>
