- Unlike other programming languages, 
- Swift does not require you to create separate interface and implementation files for custom classes and structures. 
- In Swift, you define a class or a structure in a single file, 
- and the external interface to that class or structure is automatically made available for other code to use.
- example of a structure definition and a class definition:

```
struct Resolution {
    var width = 0
    var height = 0
}
class VideoMode {
    var resolution = Resolution()
    var interlaced = false
    var frameRate = 0.0
    var name: String?
}
```
