  It's that time of year again - time for you to vote for what presentations you would like to see at the OpenStack Design Summit. 
  
  My goal over the past three OpenStack Design Summits has been to speak on topics that lower the barrier to entry to using and contributing to OpenStack. Topics like training, community and tools have all been top of mind to help enable the community.

It&#8217;s that time of year again &#8211;[** time for you to vote for what presentations you would like to see at the OpenStack Design Summit. **][1]

My goal over the past three OpenStack Design Summits has been to speak on topics that lower the barrier to entry to using and contributing to OpenStack. Topics like training, community and tools have all been top of mind to help enable the community.

This summit I have teamed up with some brilliant people to submit some presentations and workshops that I think will benefit the community immensely.

</h2>

The OpenStack Associate engineer course is a two day course that will equip the trainee with the knowledge and skills necessary to install, deploy and manage a three node OpenStack installation following the RefStack architecture as defined in the OpenStack Basic Install Guide.

The course is delivered as a mix of instructor led and lab training enabling the student to create a working virtualized lab instances running on their local machine, or infrastructure in their own environment as connectivity allows.

This course was generated by the OpenStack user community, and is intended to be delivered and improved by both the user community and commercial entities in both self paced, and instructor led formats.

</h2>

Continuing on the theme of OpenStack User Group coordination from the last OpenStack Summit, this session will be an interactive brain storming session to think about how all the user groups all over the world can collaborate together. We&#8217;ll discuss ideas like the following:

  * Common repository for hosting slides/recordings.
  * Coordinating joint user group meetings.
  * Joint sharing and awareness of talks from other user groups.
  * Guest speaker arrangements.

The idea is to discuss these in a panel format with audience partiicpation and continue to grow interest in all of these areas as more and more user groups come online across the world. We want to ensure all the user groups are succesful, and this is one way to help make that happen.

</h2>

The idea of training people of all skills sets who attend the user group meetings has been around since the openstack user groups started. We discussed training in great detail at the last summit. There has been significant progress on the community side of training since then. We want to socialize what has been completed so far and what is next. Join us to contribute to the discussion and find out how you can get involved.
