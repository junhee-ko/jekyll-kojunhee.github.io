 Today was the official release date for the CCDE exam. To quote Cisco &#8211;  
&#8220;CCDE Assesses advanced Network Infrastructure Design Principles and Fundamentals for large networks. A CCDE can demonstrate an ability to develop solutions which address planning, design, integration, optimization, operations, security and ongoing support focused at the infrastructure level for customer networks&#8221;

For the engineering perspective on this, the CCDE is equivalent  to the CCIE. However, the CCDE is focused on design and architecture rather then implementation. Where the CCIE (R&S, Voice, Security, Service Provider, Storage) is focused on implementation, the CCDE is focused more on the pre-sales design and architecture efforts. I am personally looking forward to the lab being released, as it provides a certification to validate the skill set needed to be an sales engineer on Enterprise accounts, or to be a network architect at an Enterprise corporation.

It is funny how small a world it is. Eplus (the company I work for) CEO &#8211; Phil Norton was quoted on Cisco&#8217;s press release &#8211;

&#8220;Certifications provide a stamp of approval that validates the quality of our organization&#8217;s employees,&#8221; said Phil Norton, chairman, CEO and president of ePlus. &#8220;The CCDE isn&#8217;t about operations; it&#8217;s about recognizing the value of network designers and honoring their core skills that provide a real value to our business and our customers.&#8221;

My gut feel when I first got invited to the CCDE beta program was that this will become a requirement for the Channel. I think Phil&#8217;s statement cements that gut feel into a reality. Obtaining a CCDE will become similar to the CCIE &#8211; a check box that you must attain to work with the top VAR&#8217;s out there. This makes me extremely grateful that I was lucky enough to be invited into the beta group to be allowed first crack at this gem of a certification.
