For the third year in a row I&#8217;m having my head shaved to stand in solidarity with kids fighting cancer, but more importantly, to raise money to find cures.

Please support me with a donation to the St. Baldrick&#8217;s Foundation. This volunteer-driven charity funds more in childhood cancer research grants than any organization except the U.S. government.

Your gift will give hope to infants, children, teens and young adults fighting childhood cancers. So when I ask for your support, I&#8217;m really asking you to support these kids. Thank you!

I&#8217;ve thrown the first 100 into the till, and have a couple hundred left to throw in tonight. If you can, throw a couple bucks to the donation link and help us to end childhood cancer
