## Integers

-  signed (positive, zero, or negative)
-  unsigned (positive or zero)
	
	-  8-bit unsigned integer : UInt8
	-  32-bit signed integer : Int32

- Int

	- On a 32-bit platform, Int is the same size as Int32.
	- On a 64-bit platform, Int is the same size as Int64.

	- always use Int for integer values in your code

- UInt

	- On a 32-bit platform, UInt is the same size as UInt32.
	- On a 64-bit platform, UInt is the same size as UInt64.

	- Int is preferred, even when the values to be stored are known to be nonnegative

## Booleans

	```
	let orangesAreOrange = true
	let turnipsAreDelicious = false
	
	if turnipsAreDelicious {
	    print("Mmm, tasty turnips!")
	} else {
	    print("Eww, turnips are horrible.")
	}
	
	// Prints "Eww, turnips are horrible."
	```

- Swift’s type safety prevents non-Boolean values from being substituted for Bool

	```
	let i = 1
	if i {
	    // this example will not compile, and will report an error
	}
	```

- The result of the i == 1 comparison is of type Bool,
- and so this second example passes the type-check. 

	```
	let i = 1
	if i == 1 {
	    // this example will compile successfully
	}
	```

## Floating-Point Numbers

- Double represents a 64-bit floating-point number.
- Float represents a 32-bit floating-point number.

	- In situations where either type would be appropriate, Double is preferred.

## Strings and Characters

- String Literals
	
	- A literal value is a value that appears directly in your source code
	- Swift infers a type of String for the someString constant 
	- because it’s initialized with a string literal value.
	
		```
		let someString = "Some string literal value"
		```	

- Initializing an Empty String
	
	```
	var emptyString = ""               // empty string literal
	var anotherEmptyString = String()  // initializer syntax
	// these two strings are both empty, and are equivalent to each other
	```
	
- String Mutability
	
	```
	var variableString = "Horse"
	variableString += " and carriage"
	// variableString is now "Horse and carriage"
	 
	let constantString = "Highlander"
	constantString += " and another Highlander"
	// this reports a compile-time error - a constant string cannot be modified
	```
