I have been learning all the right ways to build a website that Google can understand. Along the way I set a couple of goals.

  1. The first and foremost goal is to only use &#8220;white hat&#8221; or legal ways of increasing her visibility
  2. Get Ashley on page 1 for four target keywords
  3. Get An indented listing

Well, it looks like I met my initial goals. Now to move to some more generic keywords and see what goes from there.
