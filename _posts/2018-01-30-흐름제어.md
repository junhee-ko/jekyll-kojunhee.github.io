## For-In Loops

-  to iterate over the items in an array:

```
let names = ["Anna", "Alex", "Brian", "Jack"]
for name in names {
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}
// Hello, Anna!
// Hello, Alex!
// Hello, Brian!
// Hello, Jack!
```

- The contents of a Dictionary are inherently unordered, and iterating over them does not guarantee the order in which they will be retrieved

```
let numberOfLegs = ["spider": 8, "ant": 6, "cat": 4]
for (animalName, legCount) in numberOfLegs {
    print("\(animalName)s have \(legCount) legs")
}
// ants have 6 legs
// spiders have 8 legs
// cats have 4 legs

//
```

- for-in loops with numeric ranges.

```
for index in 1...5 {
    print("\(index) times 5 is \(index * 5)")
}
// 1 times 5 is 5
// 2 times 5 is 10
// 3 times 5 is 15
// 4 times 5 is 20
// 5 times 5 is 25
```

- If you don’t need each value from a sequence

```
let base = 3
let power = 10
var answer = 1
for _ in 1...power {
    answer *= base
}
print("\(base) to the power of \(power) is \(answer)")
// Prints "3 to the power of 10 is 59049"
```

-  to include the lower bound but not the upper bound

```
let minutes = 60
for tickMark in 0..<minutes {
    // render the tick mark each minute (60 times)
}
```

- stride(from:to:by:)

```
let minuteInterval = 5
for tickMark in stride(from: 0, to: minutes, by: minuteInterval) {
    // render the tick mark every 5 minutes (0, 5, 10, 15 ... 45, 50, 55)
}
```

- stride(from:through:by:)

```
let hours = 12
let hourInterval = 3
for tickMark in stride(from: 3, through: hours, by: hourInterval) {
    // render the tick mark every 3 hours (3, 6, 9, 12)
}
```

## Repeat-While

```
repeat {
    statements
} while condition
```

## Switch

```
switch some value to consider {
case value 1:
    respond to value 1
case value 2,
     value 3:
    respond to value 2 or 3
default:
    otherwise, do something else
}
```
