        I think the biggest challenge with OpenStack right now is finding a healthy balance between all user archetypes that contribute code.

        Right now, there is a risk of the sometimes conflicting interests between each of those Archetypes creating situations that stall forward progress of this great project. We need the Neutron PTL to hit this issue straight in the face before it gets toxic.

      Why Kyle is the right person for Neutron PTL
    </h3>
    
    <div class="paragraph" style="clear: left;">
      <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="NewImage.png" alt="NewImage" src="http://www.colinmcnamara.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/NewImage.png" width="500" height="374" border="0" /></p> 
      
      <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
        First, let me say that Mark is an amazing PTL. His leadership has been great, and I’m sure will be great in the future. As an employee of an Operator (Yahoo) he is a close to neutral ground as we can get.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
        That does mean however that he may not always be fully aware of all the ways that manufacturer politics and angling can manifest themselves in a project.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
        This is where Kyle comes in. Kyle works for Cisco (specifically an OpenSource spin in called Noiro).. but still Cisco. I have known Kyle since 2012, and in that time I have seen Kyle at ever turn do what is best for the community, even when that may not have been “completely the best thing” for his employer.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
        Day in and day out, I see Kyle act like I feel (and hopefully how I do). Exemplifying the “Badges Away” philosophy, and using OpenSource to build a bridge of collaboration between parties that at many times compete with each other. This leadership style is demonstrated in OpenStack, Open vSwitch, and OpenDaylight.

      Kyle will be under scrutiny
    </h3>
    
    <div class="paragraph" style="clear: left;">
      <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
        The fact is, that with a manufacturer employee taking a leadership role in a project there is always a risk that a manufactures agenda will be pushed.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
        That however is a great thing, Kyle will be under the highest levels of scrutiny. Him taking this role will require a new level of transparency around manufacture dev reviews and approvals, and will result in increased health as the project as a whole.

      Kyle’s biggest task as PTL
    </h3>
    
    <div class="paragraph" style="clear: left;">
      <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
        OpenStack is maturing from a project full of beards and tattoos, to a place where suits are as common as birkenstocks. What is happening is that the same market manipulation tactics that are rampant in IETF, T11 an IEEE are making their way into OpenStack (They were a heavy undercurrent in the Hong Kong summit).
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
        Kyle’s biggest task that I see is setting up transparent policies that discourage standards body manipulation techniques, and ensure that the contributors outside of the manufactures have an equal chance to both share the burden of contribution, but also enjoy it’s benefits.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
        At the end of the day, in the few years that I have known Kyie, he has stood out as an individual who loves this community. Who is connected to us as a whole, and who also strives to find “balance in the force”
      </p>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
        <strong style="color: #083194;">This is why I am eager to see Kyle elected as the Neutron PTL</strong>. If you feel the same way as I do, I encourage you to make your opinion known too.
