OpenStack training is gaining steam and momentum. We are almost halfway through the work to finish the associate guide. The most import item for maintaining and accelerating the Training Guides is to get more people to contribute.

Last week at the SFbay OpenStack Hackathon we got a couple individuals through their first commit. It started with a live demonstration of the process for creating a new section in the training guide. Since we were holding the meetup via Google hangouts live, we had the entire thing recorded. I edited the content so now there is also a video walkthrough of the contribution process.



I hope this work continues to lower the barriers to entry to contributing. If it helps, please tell me on twitter &#8211; [@colinmcnamaraÂ ][1]
