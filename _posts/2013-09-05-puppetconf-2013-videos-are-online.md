Last month I encouraged everyone to sign up for PuppetConf, a DevOps conference run by PuppetLabs.For those of you that weren&#8217;t able to attend in person, or you are like me and were interested in a bunch of different sessions that conflicted, PuppetLabs is kind enough to post the larger sessions to their YouTube channel, with the master list housed here &#8211; <http://puppetlabs.com/resources/puppetconf-2013>
