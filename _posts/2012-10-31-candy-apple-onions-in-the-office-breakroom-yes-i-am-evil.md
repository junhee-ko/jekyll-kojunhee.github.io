Have you ever done something completely evil to your coworkers? I just did. I was inspired by this post &#8211; <http://www.lolriot.com/2011/11/11/lol-pics-28-37-images/onion-candy-apples/>  Where a dad tricked his kids into biting into a luscious candy ONION. Needless to say the kids were appalled.

  <strong>Which one of these is the candy apple onion?</strong>

**It WORKED! **Matt Jenson took a bite of a slice of Candy Covered Onion. Thankfully he was a great sport about it.

Happy halloween everybody. And remember, it is **TRICK or TREAT**. You don&#8217;t always get a treat….
