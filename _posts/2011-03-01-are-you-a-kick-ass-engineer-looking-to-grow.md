<span style="font-size: medium;">### Update &#8211; An outstanding engineer has survived the interview process. This consisted of multiple days of interviews, including a six hour tech interview proctored by multiple CCIE&#8217;s. Thanks to everyone who contacted me about this position.###</span>

Are you a single or multiple CCIE who can present with confidence one minute, step to a whiteboard and do a design session and thenÂ  hop on a device and configure high end solutions the next?

Are you looking for an opportunity to work with the largest and most challenging enterprise customers in Silicon Valley, working with bleeding edge products and designs?

Do you want to work on a team with 18 CCIE&#8217;s nationwide, and 5 in this office alone?

If so, you are in luck. We are adding another senior engineering position to our enterprise sales team. If you have the traits listed above you just might be a great addition to the team.

A little background on ePlus &#8211;

ePlus is a national DVAR with 20 offices across the nation. It was founded in 1990 and is publicly traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol PLUS. We have 690 employees nationally, of which 160+ were senior engineers. You would be working in the Sunnyvale California office which has just over 50 employees of which 25 are engineers.

So do you have what it takes?

Sorry recruiters, this is for direct candidates only.
