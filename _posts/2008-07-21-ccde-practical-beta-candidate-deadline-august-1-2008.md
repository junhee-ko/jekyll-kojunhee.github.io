I just received an email from Cisco finally revealing what benefit the CCDE beta program members will receive for being good little test subjects.

> As a CCDE beta participant on the qualification exam, you have given us your time and feedback and have made a significant commitment to making this a valuable program in the market. As a token of our appreciation for your commitment to the success of the program, if you qualify, we are offering the beta of the practical exam to you at a reduced price of $700, a savings of $280 off the retail price of the beta exam along with a priority seat. Cisco will be offering this beta delivery of the exam on October 1, 2008, in Chicago, IL at a Pearson professional testing center. This is an exceptional offer and opportunity to be one of the first individuals in the world to obtain their CCDE certification.

There is a catch here, and hopefully everyone who is participating is able to pull their heads out of current projects soon enough to catch it.

> We can&#8217;t keep priority seats forever so we&#8217;ll need your commitment by August 1, 2008. After August 1, 2008 you will be registering under open enrollment rules and we cannot guarantee your seat.

That&#8217;s right, you have 11 days to reply to the email, or forever hold your peace. In my case, them email is already sent. Hopefully I can talk my VP into letting me take that $280 I &#8220;saved&#8221; him and apply it to a really posh hotel.
