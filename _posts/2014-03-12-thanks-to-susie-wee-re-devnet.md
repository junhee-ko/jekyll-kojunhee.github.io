Public discussion around features and deficiencies is an important piece of this modern world of OpenSource and social media. It is easy to start a public discussion around deficiencies. It is also important to have a public discussion around success.

### I want to use this opportunity to acknowledge Susie Wee and her teams at Cisco.

Susie and her teams responded to public feedback and improving the developer experience with developer.cisco.com. &#8211;  <http://www.colinmcnamara.com/open-letter-to-cisco-about-devnet/>

The experience before.. was pretty bad &#8211;

It is near impossible, to use DevNet to find information that we need to be able to achieve our goal. I think that’s your goal, helping guys like us integrate our software with gear like yours.</span>

### Susie and team significantly improved the user experience on [developer.cisco.com][1]

Now all the product specific links have been removed. I got to API docs on my first try. I have to say, I am happy with this, and am looking forward to seeing further improvements and integrations in the future.

As I said at the beginning, it is important to discuss both issues and success. Thank you very much Susie for taking feedback and improving me and my teams experience. I appreciate it.
