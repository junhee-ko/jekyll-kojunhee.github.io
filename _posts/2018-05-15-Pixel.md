#### Pixel

- Pixel is the smallest element of an image.
- Each pixel correspond to any one value.
  - In an 8-bit gray scale image, the value of the pixel between 0 and 255
  - each value denotes the intensity of light at that point of the image.

#### Calculation of total number of pixels

- We have define an image as a two dimensional signal or matrix.
- Total number of pixels
  - number of rows ( X ) number of columns
  - the number of (x,y) coordinate pairs

#### Gray Scale

- The value of the pixel at any point denotes the intensity of image at that location, and that is also known as gray level.

#### Pixel value (0)

- each pixel can have only one value and each value denotes the intensity of light at that point of the image.

- The value 0 means absence of light. 

- It means that 0 denotes dark, 

- and it further means that when ever a pixel has a value of 0, it means at that point, black color would be formed.

- this image matrix has all filled up with 0. 

- All the pixels have a value of 0.Â 

- an image would be formed with 9 pixels, 

- and that image would have a dimension of 3 rows and 3 column 

- and most importantly that image would be black.

- Because all the pixels in the image had a value of 0.
