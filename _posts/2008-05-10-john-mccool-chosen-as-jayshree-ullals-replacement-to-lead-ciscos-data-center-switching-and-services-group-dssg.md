John McCool was chosen to succeed Jayshree Ullal as the leader of the DSSG yesterday. John comes with a rich development background on both the 4500 and 6500 series platforms, as well participating in internet standards bodies.

Please join me in welcoming John McCool to his new position as the leader of (in my opinion) Cisco&#8217;s most strategic business units.
