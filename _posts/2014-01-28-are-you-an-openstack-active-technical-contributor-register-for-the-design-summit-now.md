Stefano just sent out the registration codes for the spring design summit in Atlanta. If you are like me, you probably went right to the code, clicked the link to the website and wen’t to register with EventBright. The danger is, if you are like me, you might have almost accidentally charged $600 dollars to your credit card.

## What you need to click (thanks Stef for sending this out)

Thanks Stefano for sending this out. Pay close attention to the ***ENTER PROMOTIONAL CODE LINK***

Click on that, enter the code you received from Stefano, and profit.
