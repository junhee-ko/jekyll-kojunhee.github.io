- Intent

  - A class should have only one reason to change.

- Bad Example

  - each change for a responsibility might affect the other one:
    - Adding a new protocol will create the need to add code for parsing and serializing the content for each type of field.
    - Adding a new content type (like html) make us to add code for each protocol implemented.
