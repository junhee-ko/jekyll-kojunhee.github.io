- You use optionals in situations where a value may be absen

-  An optional represents two possibilities: 

	- Either there is a value, and you can unwrap the optional to access that value, 
	- or there isn’t a value at all.

- The example below uses the initializer to try to convert a String into an Int:

```
let possibleNumber = "123"
let convertedNumber = Int(possibleNumber)
// convertedNumber is inferred to be of type "Int?", or "optional Int"
```

- Because the initializer might fail, it returns an optional Int, rather than an Int. 
- An optional Int is written as Int?, not Int. 
- The question mark indicates that the value it contains is optional, 
- meaning that it might contain some Int value, 
- or it might contain no value at all. 
- (It can’t contain anything else, such as a Bool value or a String value. It’s either an Int, or it’s nothing at all.)
