## What is a mask

- A mask is a filter.
- Concept of masking is also known as spatial filtering. 
- Masking is also known as filtering. 
- In this concept we just deal with the filtering operation that is performed directly on the image.

## What is filtering?

- The process of filtering is also known as convolving a mask with an image. 
- As this process is same of convolution so filter masks are also known as convolution masks.

## How it is done

- The general process of filtering and applying masks is consists of moving the filter mask from point to point in an image. 
- At each point (x,y) of the original image, the response of a filter is calculated by a pre defined relationship. 
- All the filters values are pre defined and are a standard.

## Types of filters

- Generally there are two types of filters. 
  - linear filters or smoothing filters 
  - frequency domain filters.

## Why filters are used?

- for Blurring and noise reduction

- edge detection and sharpness

## Blurring and noise reduction

- Blurring is used in pre processing steps, such as removal of small details from an image prior to large object extraction.

## Masks for blurring

- The common masks for blurring are.
  - Box filter
  - Weighted average filter
- In the process of blurring we reduce the edge content in an image and try to make the transitions between different pixel intensities as smooth as possible.
- Noise reduction is also possible with the help of blurring.

## Edge Detection and sharpness

- Masks or filters can also be used for edge detection in an image and to increase sharpness of an image.

## What are edges

- We can also say that sudden changes of discontinuities in an image are called as edges. 

- Significant transitions in an image are called as edges.
