> <span>Network World and the authors have decided to remove this blog post and the discussion that followed. While the original post was intended to highlight how the issue of braindumps is a pervasive one, we regret having singled out anyone in particular and apologize for any accusations of cheating.</span>

I hope that Ethan is watching the outflow of support for him, and puts his site back up soon.
