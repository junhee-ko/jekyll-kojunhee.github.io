It is not often that you can get three great looking guys to sit down together and talk without the ladies hurtling themselves towards them. Luckily this was filmed at Cisco live where there are practically none present. Without this distraction [Josh Atwell][1], [Fred Nix][2] and I ([Colin McNamara][3]) were able to sit down and have a short discussion about Cisco and EMC&#8217;s joint reference architecture, VSPEX.



In all seriousness it was a blast to spend time chatting with these guys, and it highlights the value that VSPEX brings to our customers. Just like on the couch VSPEX only can only be delivered when Cisco, EMC and their mutual channel partners, in this case Nexus jointly deliver a flexible, reference architecture based solution.
