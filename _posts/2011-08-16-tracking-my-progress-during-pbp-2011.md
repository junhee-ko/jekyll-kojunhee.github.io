I am a bit of a cycling fanatic. My events of choice are ultra-endurance events lasting 200 miles or more.

For the last two years I have been training with a goal of finishing the oldest bicycling event in history, Paris-Brest-Paris. This event has been held every 4 years since 1896, and is 1200 kilometers (roughly 750 miles) long. Roughly 700 of us Americans qualified to go this time, and I am one of them.

For those of you that want to track my progress while I am on the road ACP (the group who runs PBP) has implemented a RFID tracking system that will track me as I move between checkpoints on the course. You can monitor my progress starting on Aug 21st at 6:00 pm CEST (Paris Time) by going to the page below and entering in the frame number 4500.

Frame number = 4500

Bonne Route!Â  &#8211;Colin
