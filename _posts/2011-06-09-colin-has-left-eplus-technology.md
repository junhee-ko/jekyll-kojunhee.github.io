After an awesome four and a half years I have decided to leave ePlus. My last day was June 8th.

I have to admit, it was an extremely hard decision. Of the past half of a decade ePlus has provided unquestioned support for &#8220;crazy&#8221; ideas like using service provider technology in enterprise designs, or focusing on this new and crazy &#8220;Data Center&#8221; thing four years ago. Having support to explore and thrive on the bleeding edge of technology while working with some of the largest customers in the world made every day an adventure.

The most transformational experiment for me personally was implementing an overlay model in the western area. I have to thank the Area VP and corporate leadership for taking the risk and allowing us to transform the business from Voice and R/S partner to the top Data Center partner in the west. Trusting and empowering us with this change was a huge opportunity, and I wouldn&#8217;t be where I am today without that experience. Thank you.

Over the years as people have changed employers I have always said that teams span corporate boundaries. I hope that as I embark on my next challenge that we continue that tradition and keep in touch.
