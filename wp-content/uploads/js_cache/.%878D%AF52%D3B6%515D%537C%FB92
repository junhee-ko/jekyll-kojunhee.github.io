An eagle was sitting on a tree resting, doing nothing.A small rabbit saw the eagle and asked him <em>how to buy viagra online</em>, "Can I also sit like you and do nothing?"
The eagle answered: "Sure, why not" So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the eagle and rested.
All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it.

Management Lesson:
To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up.

Lesson Two:
A turkey was chatting with a bull."I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree," sighed the turkey, "but I haven't got the energy."
"Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?" replied the bull." They're packed with nutrients."
The turkey pecked at a lump of dung, and found it actually gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree; how to buy viagra online.The next day he reached the second branch and, finally, after a fourth
night, the turkey was proudly perched at the top of the tree.He was promptly spotted by a farmer <em>how to buy viagra online</em>, who shot him out of the tree.

Management Lesson:
Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there.

(3) And when you're in deep crap, it's best to keep your mouth shut!

This ends the three minute management course.
