This is the first step towards sitting for a practical examination that will hopefully be released this October.And, in response to <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/24239" target="_blank">Micheal Morris's blog post</a> - Yes Mike, I can pass the CCDE written.

The second big item on my todo list was to recertify my CCIE.Thankfully, Cisco counts the CCDE written towards my recertification requirements; <strong>viagra cialis</strong>. <strong>Viagra cialis</strong>: i am waiting for the system to update, but I think this will set me up to be certified till June of 2011.

There is one interesting side effect of passing my CCDE written the week before networkers.I had originally planned on using the free exam at networkers as a "safety" exam in case I struck out on this attempt. <em>Viagra cialis</em>: now of course, that is not necessary.Since I am already a CCIE, there isn't much incentive to take a professional level exam.

So, after weighing my options, I have decided to take the CCIE Service Provider written - <em>viagra cialis</em>.It covers much of the MPLS / IP Next Generation Networks material that I have been studying; <strong>viagra cialis</strong>.I only have 7 days to prepare, so the odds are against me - <em>viagra cialis</em>. <em>Viagra cialis</em>: however, with the heavy service provider focus in the CCDE blueprint, I have a feeling after I battle the CCDE practical I will be set to roll right into the CCIE Service Provider lab.";s:10:"post_title";s:13:"Viagra Cialis";s:13:"post_category";s:1:"0";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:71:"passed-ccde-written-recertified-my-ccie-killed-two-birds-with-one-stone";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2008-06-16 21:47:30";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2008-06-17 05:47:30";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"http://www.colinmcnamara.com/?p=132";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"5";s:10:"robotsmeta";s:0:"";}
