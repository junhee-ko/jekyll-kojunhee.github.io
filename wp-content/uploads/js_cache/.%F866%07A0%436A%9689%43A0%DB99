<blockquote>From the network world editors -

<span>Network World and the authors have decided to remove this blog post and the discussion that followed.While the original post was intended to highlight how the issue of braindumps is a pervasive one, we regret having singled out anyone in particular and apologize for any accusations of cheating.</span></blockquote>
