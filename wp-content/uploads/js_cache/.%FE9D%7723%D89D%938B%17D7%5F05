<strong>What does this certification entail?</strong>

<strong>1 - levitra online. <strong>Levitra online</strong>: ccde Certified</strong>

Yes, now the CCDE will now get MUCH more popular.You will have to pass your CCDE practical before you have a chance to submit an application to the CCA Board.

<strong>2.10 Years industry experience</strong>

A common theme that I have sense from the CCDE team (the team who created the CCA) is that the CCIE does not hold the same value as it held 10 years ago; <em>levitra online</em>. <em>Levitra online</em>: an experience requirement from the CCA not only a certain pedigree of CCA candidates, as well as the wealth of experience that time provides.

<strong>3.Application to "the board"</strong>

Translation, be careful what you put on twitter. Levitra online: a board, most likely consisting of Bruce Pinsky, Russ White and the other usual players will evaluate your application.If your application is accepted then you get to face the board.

<strong>4 - levitra online.Passing The board examination</strong>

Interestingly enough, I see this as the most straight forward portion of the entire CCDE / CCA process.Â The board exam itself is set to model a normal customer interaction for a network architect; <em>levitra online</em>.For those of us that do this every day this is straight forward.

First, you have a customer that has a requirement; <em>levitra online</em>.You gather that requirement generally in writing first; levitra online. <em>Levitra online</em>: then you have a chance to interview the customer to gather additional requirements, and more importantly the reasoning behind the requirement.

After that, you go and create a proposal that takes into account all of the requirements, applications, and "gotchas" that may happen.Create Diagrams, Bill of Materials and a Solution Overview.

You present this proposal to the customer, and defend all the aspects of your proposal; <em>levitra online</em>.Again, this is a common customer engagement - levitra online.Cisco is mirroring this whole process - <em>levitra online</em>.The two major changes involved are are 1.the customer is "the board" and instead of making a sale, you get your CCA.
