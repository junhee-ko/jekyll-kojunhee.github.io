<blockquote>
<pre>Dear Candidate:

On August 27, Cisco will introduce a pilot for the CCIE Routing and
Switching lab exam in Beijing, China. Buying cialis online: the pilot will add a 10-minute
interview that will assess the candidate's ability to apply expert-level
networking skills and knowledge to networking problems that are encountered
on the job.After the lab orientation, a panel of three experts will conduct
a verbal interview with each candidate, asking a series of expert-level
networking questions (questions and answers will be in English) - <strong>buying cialis online</strong>. <strong>Buying cialis online</strong>: the ability
to correctly answer these questions will affect the exam score.After
completing the interview, the candidate will have the entire 8 hours to
complete the lab portion of the exam.  <em>Buying cialis online</em>: these scores will then be
calculated and then combined for a total score which will decide a pass
or a fail.

Our goal with this email is to let you know that your day will extend beyond
the normal testing day by approximately one hour. The additional hour will
be at the end of the day.We hope you find this interview process
enlightening and helpful as we continue to strive for the standard the world
has come to expect from CCIE.</pre>
</blockquote>
In my opinion this change is both needed and appropriate.In the past couple years buying cialis online, the two main barriers to entry with the CCIE (access to gear, and knowledge) have been lowered with the abundance of training programs as well as dynamips and it's derivatives for gear emulation.Where in the past you were looking at a minimum of $8,000 dollars for a full lab, now you can run it on your PC at home.

From what I see, this is encouraging engineers to get their CCIE's earlier in their career - buying cialis online.This in itself is not a bad thing - <strong>buying cialis online</strong>.If an engineer has dedicated themselfs to learning all the in's and out's of networking technology, then they really have earned the title.The problem comes when people want to take short cuts; <strong>buying cialis online</strong>.They buy a lab of someone in China, or use other methods to get copies of the lab; <strong>buying cialis online</strong>. <strong>Buying cialis online</strong>: to them, passing the lab and getting their number is all that is important, not truly becoming an expert in the technology.

While in the short term this may seem like the quick path to a good salary, in the long term everybody loses.Those who have cheated their way to their CCIE (while few and far between) end up devaluing the cert for the rest of us.And at the end of the day, they are just cheating themselves, and will lose their jobs when their true skills are tested.

It looks like Cisco is seeing the same thing that I have just talked about - <em>buying cialis online</em>.This pilot program should go a long way into protecting the integrity of the CCIE for years to come - buying cialis online.";s:10:"post_title";s:20:"Buying Cialis Online";s:13:"post_category";s:1:"0";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:71:"protecting-the-integrity-of-the-ccie-lab-verbal-interviews-being-tested";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:67:"
