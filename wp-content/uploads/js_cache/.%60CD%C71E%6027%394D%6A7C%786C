Lets just start this out by saying, darn - levitra..this is going to be expensive.
Now that that is out of the way, lets get started; <strong>levitra</strong>.Cisco publishes the hardware that is in the Storage lab.

Here is the hardware summary -
<ul class="compact-bulleted">
	<li>Cisco Routers</li>
	<li>Cisco Catalyst Switches</li>
	<li>Cisco Secure Access Control System</li>
	<li>MDS 9506*</li>
	<li>MDS 9216*</li>
	<li>Port Analyzer Adapter</li>
	<li>JBOD</li>
	<li>RAID storage</li>
	<li>HBA</li>
	<li>3rd Party Fibre Channel Switch</li>
</ul>
My guess is that this equals a basic routed network with a CS-ACS server on the backend.
It looks like there is also at least 1 pc with an HBA connected into one MDS; <em>levitra</em>.The one big question I have is on the connected storage.
My guess is that Cisco's JBOD reference = Fibre Channel connected storage levitra, and the RAID array mentioned is connected to at least one server.
If my guess is right then there is the 9506 and 9216 - (note, no I in the name) and a third party switch.

So lets start the shopping list.

1.Cisco Routers
I have those coming out of the yinyang, no need to purchase anymore for this lab.

2.Cisco Catalyst Switches
Mine are a little old, but I don't expect a storage exam to have anything challenging in the switching arena; <em>levitra</em>. <em>Levitra</em>: no need to upgrade there.

3. <strong>Levitra</strong>: cisco Secure Access Control System
Thankfully Cisco provides VAR's with NFR binders.ACS will be loaded on HMB-SERVER1 in a vmware image. <strong>Levitra</strong>: no expenditure needed.

4. Levitra: mds 9506*
Holy smokes, this is a lot of money. <strong>Levitra</strong>: i have seen them on ebay for $8,000. Levitra: this includes both sup modules.I would need to buy a line card, which I see going for about 1k - levitra.so $9000

5. <strong>Levitra</strong>: mds 9216
Still bad, but not horrible. <strong>Levitra</strong>: i just saw one on ebay for $5500.Depending on lab requirements it may be smart just to get to 9216's - <strong>levitra</strong>.so $5500

6; <strong>levitra</strong>.Port Analyzer Adapter
Best I can find is $2000 refurbished - <em>levitra</em>.I have a feeling practicing using this, and seeing the ethereal dumps is going to be integral to success - <em>levitra</em>.worst case this is 2k, best case beg or borrow $2000

7; levitra. Levitra: jbod
Normally you are looking at 2-4k for one of these.My strategy is to find an old Netapp shelf, and low level format it.I found one on ebay that ends in 22 hours for $89.Sounds good to me.

8.RAID storage
I am going with my guess that this is just to facilitate data transfers between storage and host; <em>levitra</em>.My tactic is to use the existing storage inside one of my servers.$0

9.HBA
Interesting - Only one HBA .This can be up to $2000 to buy new.Luckily ebay is my friend. Levitra: i found a qlogic 2340 card for $50.My kind of deal

10; <em>levitra</em>.3rd party Fibre Channel Switch
Luckily Brocade resells to everyone and their mother - levitra.IBM, Dell, HP, Compaq, ETC.I have found some Silkworm 2800's for as low as $50 on ebay.
I do have my eye on a 3800 that is going for $24 right now (I hope it stays low).

So how much is the damage?

$16,700

Holy smokes I could sell my truck just to buy the lab gear.
