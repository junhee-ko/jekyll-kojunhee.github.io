Most engineers in the channel utilize a tool called the Dynamic Configuration Tool. <em>Cialis online pharmacy</em>: this allows you to take a product, configure it with all of its software, hardware and licensing options, give it a sanity check and then output a spreadsheet.You then take spreadsheet and combine it with the other hardware in your design to create what is called a Bill of Materials (commonly referred to as a BOM).The challenge here is if you only use the Dynamic Configuration Tool <em>cialis online pharmacy</em>, you will not see the storage specific options for the Nexus family of Data Center switches.

The solution is to use a tool called the Multi-line Configurator.In the video below, I will show you how to use this tool to create a working Nexus 5000 BOM for your customers; <strong>cialis online pharmacy</strong>.(for fullscreen hover your mouse over the video and click on the "X" next to the vimeo link.)

Normally I don't discuss channel specific topics on this blog, but my fear is that other engineers in the channel may fumble when creating BOM's around Nexus, and otherwise tarnish a really good product.Since channel specific topics is new to this blog <strong>cialis online pharmacy</strong>, it would help me out if you could ping me if you found this useful. Cialis online pharmacy: depending on the response I receive I will start sprinkling in more of channel partner specific content in the future.
