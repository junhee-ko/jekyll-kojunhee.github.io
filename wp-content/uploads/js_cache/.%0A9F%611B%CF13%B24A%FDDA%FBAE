<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial <strong>how to buy cialis</strong>,helvetica,sans-serif">My background is all over the place.It goes from running a small ISP <span style="color: #737373">when I was 18 to managing international CallManager clusters, to </span><span style="color: #737373">enterprise data center design and migrations; <strong>how to buy cialis</strong>.I swear that I have tech </span><span style="color: #737373">ADD - how to buy cialis. How to buy cialis: i see something new and I am like..oooooh shiny, lets do a sniff </span><span style="color: #737373">and see how it works.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">I actually attempted the Route Switch lab twice in 2002 (still had token </span><span style="color: #737373">ring and dlsw still) but got activated for the war before I could get my </span><span style="color: #737373">number - <em>how to buy cialis</em>.I can tell you..that sucked horribly.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">So, why did I choose to get my Storage CCIE first instead of finishing </span><span style="color: #737373">up my Route Switch first? Well, over the past couple years I have done a </span><span style="color: #737373">significant amount of IP storage (NFS, ISCSI, ATA over Ethernet, etc) </span><span style="color: #737373">including building my own IP storage heads based on linux; how to buy cialis.I had also </span><span style="color: #737373">done a little bit of fiber channel work - <strong>how to buy cialis</strong>. <em>How to buy cialis</em>: i felt that I had a significant </span><span style="color: #737373">advantage compared to most network engineers in the storage networking </span><span style="color: #737373">space.And, I think more importantly, the topics that I had to study </span><span style="color: #737373">were new and fresh - <em>how to buy cialis</em>.Whereas when I cracked open my Route Switch books..</span><span style="color: #737373">I honestly wasn't to excited about it at the time ( I think I was </span><span style="color: #737373">holding a grudge from my first attempts in 2002).</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">The partner e-learning central portion of Cisco has an Excellent lab </span><span style="color: #737373">access to labgear.net - how to buy cialis.It gives you 2 hour segments of time with 2 mds's </span><span style="color: #737373">(both with IPS blades), 1 2 port jbod, and 2 2 port servers; <strong>how to buy cialis</strong>. <em>How to buy cialis</em>: they also </span><span style="color: #737373">have introductory tutorials for most major technology segments.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">I did all of those, along with the every E-learning class that was on </span><span style="color: #737373">PEC. <em>How to buy cialis</em>: i think the major ones were the Design, Support, and CASSI classes.</span><span style="color: #737373">I took that, sat for the design and support specialist exams, and took </span><span style="color: #737373">my written last December.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">After doing all that work, I was honestly 70% there.I took a little </span><span style="color: #737373">break for january and febuary (There was no open lab dates) and then </span><span style="color: #737373">started hitting the labs I think at the end of febuary.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">For the majority of my practice I used the labs available through PEC.I </span><span style="color: #737373">also was able to weasel my way into 8 hour sessions every sunday from </span><span style="color: #737373">our channel SE.(I owe him plenty of drinks at networkers this year) For </span><span style="color: #737373">those 8 hour sessions I had labs created to summarize the major  </span><span style="color: #737373">technology areas and to be as evil as possible to myself.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">I had one attempt which didn't work out as well as I would have liked - <em>how to buy cialis</em>.</span><span style="color: #737373"> <em>How to buy cialis</em>: in RTP the lab starts at 7:15.This means if you are from the west coast </span><span style="color: #737373">like I am you will be getting up at 3:00 am in the morning for your lab; <strong>how to buy cialis</strong>.</span><span style="color: #737373">That royally kicked my but.I diverted from my attack plan and ended up</span>
<span style="color: #737373">running out of time - <em>how to buy cialis</em>.It was a classic example of letting the lab run </span><span style="color: #737373">you, instead of you running the lab.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">Luckily a data opened up just over a month later - how to buy cialis.I spent that time just</span><span style="color: #737373"> working on my speed (speed is the secret sauce); how to buy cialis. <strong>How to buy cialis</strong>: i migrated to using </span><span style="color: #737373">Fabric Manager (gui interface) instead of command line.After 2 practice </span><span style="color: #737373">runs my time had dropped 25%.I also flew out to RTP 3 days before, and </span><span style="color: #737373">made sure to relax and get on east coast time - how to buy cialis.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373"> <strong>How to buy cialis</strong>: for my final prep I got access to iementor's lab.Their lab is </span><span style="color: #737373">excellent - how to buy cialis.I cannot reinforce enough how much it contributed to my </span><span style="color: #737373">confidence in that final week; <strong>how to buy cialis</strong>.Roman was really cool about working with </span><span style="color: #737373">an existing candidate to get me squeezed in; <strong>how to buy cialis</strong>.They are really cool guys, </span><span style="color: #737373">and they have the only workbook on the market right now.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">So, I used their lab 2 days before mine, and then just chilled the day </span><span style="color: #737373">before; <em>how to buy cialis</em>.The day of the lab I had 70 points by lunch, and had completed </span><span style="color: #737373">configuration of the lab by 12:30 - how to buy cialis. How to buy cialis: i spent the rest of the day reviewing </span><span style="color: #737373">my configurations (found 2 errors), fixing one bug, and generally </span><span style="color: #737373">harassing the proctor to make sure I didn't misinterpret anything.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color: #737373">So..if I had it all to do over again what would I do - <strong>how to buy cialis</strong>.</span><span style="color: #737373"> <em>How to buy cialis</em>: i would still do the PEC stuff, and continue to primarily live in the </span><span style="color: #737373">Doc CD.Though I would probably pony up the cash and buy the iementor </span><span style="color: #737373">book and more lab time with them; <em>how to buy cialis</em>.</span></span>
