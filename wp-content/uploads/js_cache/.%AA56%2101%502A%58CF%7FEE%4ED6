<strong>What useability enhancements do you feel are the most beneficial?  </strong>
<ol>
	<li>A separate, IP enabled, Management Interface.This has been a long time coming. <strong>Buy cialis online in usa</strong>: the out of band management interface is very similar to a Ilo card in the HP world.it is effectively a supercharged console server that happens to site on the backplane of the sup engine.I am sure whoever pushed this feature through is going to get flowers one day from a Tech who DIDN'T lock himself out because the management interface was effectively a separate system.</li>
	<li>Finally, a functionally USB Interface that I can transfer IOS (well, now NX-OS) images through; buy cialis online in usa.Everyone has a USB key nowadays buy cialis online in usa, even my Grandmother has one, it will make life so much easier when I can have a 4 gig key with me that has most IOS / NX-OS  versions and my common configs and just pop them right in.</li>
	<li>The integrated Cabling system is CLEAN.I love that it forces you to reserve the appropriate space for cabling <em>buy cialis online in usa</em>, and that there finally is the possibility to avoid the flying spaghetti train wreck we see so often in Data Centers.</li>
	<li>Front to back Cooling.The cooling design is well thought out; <strong>buy cialis online in usa</strong>.I liked the fact that it draws from directly above the front floor and exits rear top - <strong>buy cialis online in usa</strong>.. <em>Buy cialis online in usa</em>: this should help out in raised floor data centers that have a large temperature gradient as you move to the top of the rack. <em>Buy cialis online in usa</em>: it also negates problem of having multiple 6500 chassis side to side and having warm air blowing from the exhaust of one 6500 to the intake of another 6500.</li>
	<li>Fan Slots are now placed where it is IMPOSSIBLE to cover with cables.I would say 7 out of 10 times when I walk into a new customers Data Center I find that there are cables run directly over the fan tray with no slack - buy cialis online in usa.That is not a failure in design per say, but it could have been avoided.With the Nexus 7000 fan trays in the back the problem is solved before it is created.</li>
	<li>Power supplies are in the back  - <em>buy cialis online in usa</em>.FAR away from the data cabling; buy cialis online in usa.It never fails that 20 amp circuits get uncomfortably close to copper cabling; <strong>buy cialis online in usa</strong>.By moving the power supplies to the back side of the chassis, this becomes a mute point and we remove any shadow of a doubt about EM interference causing craziness in our cabling.</li>
	<li>This one sounds really mundane, but a quick heads up grouping of status lights - buy cialis online in usa.In the past these were normally in a position where you had to squat down to see them, or they are obscured by cables; <em>buy cialis online in usa</em>.Buy putting them on the front of the cable tray assembly it ensures these will always be visible.</li>
</ol>
<strong>What can we focus on now to make it a better platform?</strong>
<ol>
	<li>One thing that worried me a little was the placement of the compact flash cards in the supervisory module.For those how haven't it up close look at this <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9402/prod_view_selector.html" target="_blank">picture of the chassis </a> and look for the Grey cover midway up the sup modules in the center slots - <em>buy cialis online in usa</em>.Behind them are two flash cards, one for system partition extension, and one to dump log files into. <em>Buy cialis online in usa</em>: having these cards available are great features however I could see an operational process of security rotating out the log partitions, or more likely and engineer pulling the flash card after dumping some data for analysis to it, and then pulling the wrong card by accident.Having a simple strap (like the screw downs for power supply plugs) or something similar would go along way towards mitigating that risk.</li>
	<li>Continue with the spirit of innovation that has defined Cisco over the years. <strong>Buy cialis online in usa</strong>: cisco has consistently came out with or acquired and integrated many great products that directly address the needs of the market place into the product line (MARS, ASA, AireSpace, TelePresence, MDS, ACE, Etc) but frankly the last <em>GAME CHANGING </em>product that set the industry on its heals and forced everyone to rethink how we utilize technology to accelerate business as a whole was the acquisition of Selsius and the introduction of VOIP as an enterprise class product to the world.I remember having the hair stand up on my arms from the excitement of going up against Avaya and Nortel back then and fighting that uphill battle <em>buy cialis online in usa</em>, educating customers and peers about this "new thing called VOIP and how CallManager (now Unified Communications Manager) is your ticket towards productivity.

When we talk about the Virtual DataCenter, I/O Virtualization (FCOE) and VFrame Automation it is not just another incremental improvement of existing technology. <em>Buy cialis online in usa</em>: it is a paradigm shift, a leap ahead, a <em>GAME CHANGER</em>. Buy cialis online in usa: i get the same chills that I did when VOIP was new because I know that those are technologies that will force us to rethink how we approach computing and data systems.These technologies are to the Data Center what IP telephony was to the PBX, and Cisco is the only company with technologies and engineering know how in all the verticals necessary to pull this off.</li>
