We had it designed by Bludomain.com.At first I was a little reticent about using them <strong>levitra without prescription</strong>, but  now I am very happy about the move.The interface for maintaining gallery's is superior to how I was doing them before.In the past Ashley would bug me to update her pictures, and I would bug her to provide them in for proper format.Now she just logs onto a web interface and uploads her pictures, updates her content, and whaam..the site is updated.All this happens without one honey do this - <em>levitra without prescription</em>.I say that is worth its price in gold

Once I saw this "seamless" interface I had to figure out how they are doing it.After a little pocking around their source code I found out that they were using PHP to pull information out of a MySQL database, and use that for dynamic content insertion into a flash template; <strong>levitra without prescription</strong>.From what I can tell <em>levitra without prescription</em>, the first thing that happens is the base flash template loads.Each button shape is hard coded in flash, and an actionscript is bound to each button.
This actionscript runs a PHP web application that logs into a local MySQL database, selects from a table, creates an array, then runs a for loop to populate each submenu for items in each drop down.

The net net of this is that you can have a few default templates, and just populate unique configuration options a MySQL db.This simplifies the whole content management issue while still providing the Content Protection that flash gives you.
