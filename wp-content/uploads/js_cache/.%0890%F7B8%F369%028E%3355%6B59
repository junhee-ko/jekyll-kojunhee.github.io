GoDaddy, one of the nations largest registrars and hosting providers is distributing bloated and possibly insecure code that will cause the average user to more then double their hosting costs.In the pages below you will learn exactly what GoDaddy is doing to your server, how their support staff will try to upsell you, and the steps you need to take to ensure proper operation of your Virtual Dedicated Server.

<span style="font-size: 14pt">Background</span>

One of my new years resolutions this year was to consolidate hosting accounts into one virtual server (hosted) - <strong>buy cialis online without a prescription</strong>.I had my domains, and my old hosting with Godaddy already so it was a no brainer to try out one of GoDaddys VDS (Virtual Dedicated Servers).

I went with their 29.99 a month package, with Centos5, unlimited domains, 10Gb disk, and 256 MB of memory; <strong>buy cialis online without a prescription</strong>.This should be perfectly fine for hosting a couple MySql driven sites, and a couple gallery instances; <strong>buy cialis online without a prescription</strong>.Let me emphasise this is only handling 4 active domains <strong>buy cialis online without a prescription</strong>, two of which only have static HTML.

Provisioning was a breeze, from order to shell account only took 4 hours. Buy cialis online without a prescription: i was provided with shell access, pre-configured yum repositories, and this web control panel - simple control panel, or TurboPanel (seems to have two different names).I was able to pop into GoDaddy's control panel interface with a direct link from their server manager console, and was setting up domains in no time.(Let me throw this caveat out though, don't buy this product for your mom's hosting..; buy cialis online without a prescription..the documentation is horrible, and by horrible I mean non-existant).

So I get my server all set up a couple weeks ago, transfer all my files from <a href="http://www.2cups.com">2 Cups Solutions</a> and set up my new <a href="http://www.colinmcnamara.com">www.colinmcnamara.com</a> site - <em>buy cialis online without a prescription</em>. <em>Buy cialis online without a prescription</em>: things go just fine, I changed over to wordpress as a CMS and am totally thrilled.My applications and email are working perfectly.Plus <em>buy cialis online without a prescription</em>, I have a shell account at GoDaddy which is a very handy thing to have as a network engineer.Things are going so well, that I give my buddy Rick a Christmas present and get <a href="http://www.ricksdavis.com">ricksdavis.com</a> and <a href="http://www.el-cinco.net" target="_blank">el-cinco.net</a> for him, and host it on my GoDaddy VDS.I go ahead and purchase the domain through godaddy's domain manager; <em>buy cialis online without a prescription</em>.This is obviously GoDaddy's core competency, and goes flawlessly as usual; <strong>buy cialis online without a prescription</strong>.Next step <em>buy cialis online without a prescription</em>, I go into the Turbo Panel web interface.Let me give you a little background on TurboPanel.This is the "free" equivalent "to plesk or cpanel.It is actually ok for automating your domain provisioning, though if you are a normal skill level user, I would recommend paying the extra 9.99 a month for Cpanel.

<span style="font-size: 14pt">Server Error</span>

I open up my TurboPanel interface and go to provision ricksdavis.com into the domain manager.It comes back with the least descriptive error I have ever received.

This is the most descriptive error ever right? it tells you what is wrong, has a link to the support system, and gives you actionable information....I would say a resounding NO.  <em>Buy cialis online without a prescription</em>: this is a classic example of why friends don't let friends program in Java. When I got this error last night, I was scratching my head; buy cialis online without a prescription.As an engineer, the first thing I will look at is the last change to the system - buy cialis online without a prescription. <strong>Buy cialis online without a prescription</strong>: coincidentally I had installed awstats two nights before, and looking at my change logs, I saw that I had upgraded my perl version.So, with no fast response to the support email from GoDaddy I chose to put in a server re provision request (fully automated) and restore from my backups - buy cialis online without a prescription. That process took about an hour, but afterwards I was back online with no errors - <em>buy cialis online without a prescription</em>.Eureka! I found it (I thought) - <strong>buy cialis online without a prescription</strong>.I provisioned Rick's domain <em>buy cialis online without a prescription</em>, wordpress, gallery2 etc and then went to bed.

<span style="font-size: 14pt">GoDaddy Support Response </span>

Fast forward to this morning, and I finally recieve an email reply from godaddy support.The email is pasted below-

(I have replaced the agents name with John Doe. Buy cialis online without a prescription: tech support is a hard job and I see no reason to highlight him specifically)

Before re-provisioning the server, I went ahead and tried the old three finger salute (reboot) the error still existed.So even if this email would have came to me on time, it would not have helped.

But that is besides the point.lets dig into the solution

The agent suggested the following fix -

Restart tomcat - which I was NOT using for any of my web applications (not an ejb guy)

/etc/init.d/tomcat55 restart

Restart TurboPanel (or simple control panel now - they haven't updated their init scripts)

/etc/init.d/turbopanel restart

<span style="font-size: 14pt">GoDaddy tried to upsell me, instead of fixing their code</span>

He gives the standard, run less stuff on your server speech (remember, I only have 4 domains on this server)

Now here is the kicker - <strong>To remedy this issue long-term, you could either setup a server with 512mb RAM, or upgrade to a Dedicated server.</strong>

What the heck is with that? I should not need an upgrade with only 4 domains on a server.Especially when in the setup the default Cpanel implies support of 30 domains; <em>buy cialis online without a prescription</em>.Is this Tech Support or a Sales Call?

But, since my server was working fine I don't pay much attention to the email and move on with my life.

Fast forward an hour, and I am show Rick how to access all the features of his new site, and I figure that I need to change an email account on his domain to forward to his old account. <strong>Buy cialis online without a prescription</strong>: fine, this should take two minutes.I log onto the TurboPanel interface to put the email forward in..and there it, a big useless error screen.What the heck is with that?

So this time I actually read the email, and try the fix. <strong>Buy cialis online without a prescription</strong>: results = nothing.GoDaddy offers shell access so I log in, run top and filter for %memory used - <strong>buy cialis online without a prescription</strong>.Low and behold, there is only 8142 bytes of memory free, and a Java process owned by root is using 300Mb of virtual memory, and 132Mb of real memory, and Tomcat is using 115Mb of virtual memory and 86Mb of real memory.

Let me translate this into English - <strong>Godaddy's control panel application was using 218 Megabytes of the 256 Megabytes of memory I had purchased.That left me with 34 Megabytes of memory</strong> . Buy cialis online without a prescription: let  me clarify this, I had paid for a virtual server with 256Mb of ram, up to 1000Mb bursted (which I think is their code for swap). I am only running 4 domains on this server buy cialis online without a prescription, and two pop3 email servers.This should not be a problem.So what is the cause of the problem? I can sum it up, crappy Java programming - buy cialis online without a prescription.Someone decided to write this program in Java (probably easier to outsource) instead of optimising it to run on lean systems. <strong>Buy cialis online without a prescription</strong>: their code effectively takes up all the available memory.And on top of that buy cialis online without a prescription, they are are running a webserver process as root...yes as root.It is like asking for your server to get hacked.

<span style="font-size: 18pt"><strong>Now <strong>buy cialis online without a prescription</strong>, that I am done ranting, let me highlight how to fix this problem.</strong></span>

I managed to stay with Godaddy and use their Virtual Dedicated Servers for 12 months.
