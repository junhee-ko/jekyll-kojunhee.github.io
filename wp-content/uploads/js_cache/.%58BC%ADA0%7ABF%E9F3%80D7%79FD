<blockquote>It is truly my pleasure and honor to join Arista Networks as the President and CEO of the company.I have known founders, Andy Bechtolsheim and David Cheriton for a decade and worked with them closely during their Granite/Cisco days.To me <strong>accessrx.com</strong>, Arista is a symbol of an exciting, innovative silicon valley start-up company at the brink of pioneering new models for cloud networking.

After corporate life and managing multibillion dollars of business at Cisco Systems, you might ask why I chose Arista Networks? Three things really drew me here:
<ol>
	<li>A top-notch and talented team, with focus on best of breed products and innovative EOSâ„¢ (Extensible Operating System) technology.</li>
	<li>Working with Andy Bechtolsheim, and our long-standing 20+ year professional kinship.</li>
	<li>A truly unique opportunity in our industry to build and grow into a great company!</li>
</ol>

Inside of Cisco Jayshree proved herself as a leader that could get results.There was even speculation that she was tagged to be John Chambers eventual replacement - <em>accessrx.com</em>.I have a feeling the same qualities that drove her success inside of Cisco will follow her as she explores this new opportunity.";s:10:"post_title";s:12:"Accessrx.com";s:13:"post_category";s:1:"0";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:48:"jayshree-ullal-takes-the-helm-of-arista-networks";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2008-11-17 10:35:13";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2008-11-17 18:35:13";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"http://www.colinmcnamara.com/?p=305";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:10:"robotsmeta";s:0:"";}
