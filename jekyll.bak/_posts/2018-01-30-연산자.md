- Unary Minus Operator

	```
	let three = 3
	let minusThree = -three       // minusThree equals -3
	let plusThree = -minusThree   // plusThree equals 3, or "minus minus three"
	```

- Unary Plus Operator

	```
	let minusSix = -6
	let alsoMinusSix = +minusSix  // alsoMinusSix equals -6
	```
	
- Comparison Operators

	```
	(1, "zebra") < (2, "apple")   // true because 1 is less than 2; "zebra" and "apple" are not compared
	(3, "apple") < (3, "bird")    // true because 3 is equal to 3, and "apple" is less than "bird"
	(4, "dog") == (4, "dog")      // true because 4 is equal to 4, and "dog" is equal to "dog"
	
	("blue", -1) < ("purple", 1)        // OK, evaluates to true
	("blue", false) < ("purple", true)  // Error because < can't compare Boolean values
	```
	
- Range Operators

	```
	for index in 1...5 {
	    print("\(index) times 5 is \(index * 5)")
	}
	// 1 times 5 is 5
	// 2 times 5 is 10
	// 3 times 5 is 15
	// 4 times 5 is 20
	// 5 times 5 is 25
	
	let names = ["Anna", "Alex", "Brian", "Jack"]
	let count = names.count
	for i in 0..<count {
	    print("Person \(i + 1) is called \(names[i])")
	}
	// Person 1 is called Anna
	// Person 2 is called Alex
	// Person 3 is called Brian
	// Person 4 is called Jack
	
	for name in names[2...] {
	    print(name)
	}
	// Brian
	// Jack
	 
	for name in names[...2] {
	    print(name)
	}
	// Anna
	// Alex
	// Brian
	
	for name in names[..<2] {
	    print(name)
	}
	// Anna
	// Alex
	
	let range = ...5
	range.contains(7)   // false
	range.contains(4)   // true
	range.contains(-1)  // true
	```
