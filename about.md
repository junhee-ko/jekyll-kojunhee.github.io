My current role is Director of the Cloud Practice and Chief Cloud Architect for Nexus IS, a Dimension Data Company. In that role I set technical direction and vision, and implement that vision through matrix’s into the business as well as teams reporting directly to me which include our Software Development teams responsible for SDN, DevOps and OpenStack development.

My primary teams focuses on software development (Mainly SDN and Cloud), and Agile Business Optimization (ITSM/ITIL to AGILE) . This allows the organization function as an  advanced technology research and development arm, effectively driving  business and technology transformation of both Nexus’s Engineering and Sales teams, as well as customers IT and Software Development organizations.

##COMMUNITY AND OPEN SOURCE

I have been been involved with Open Source since 1998 when I switched all of my web servers at my former ISP to Linux. Since then I have been involved with, evangelized and/or contributed to many open source projects including Netsaint/Nagios, Cacti, Ubuntu, Golden Cheetah, OpenStack, OpenDaylight and more.

It is my belief that Open Source platforms, and the people that create and use them have been the fuel that the fire that Silicon Valley is based on. Support and growth of these people and platforms are key to the future of the Valley, the products we create, and the people that create them, Much of the discussion is about what  I can do and want to do for OpenStack, OpenDaylight and . But it is important to consider what I have been doing.

* Evangelizing and increasing the adoption of OpenStack and OpenDaylight in user community through social media and the communities that I participate in.
* Teaching people and companies about how to best contribute to OpenStack
* Supporting and encouraging individuals in my own company (Nexus) to contribute to OpenStack, OpenDaylight as well as using it in our platforms.
* Using my influence to educate hardware manufacturers on why the should ensure that their products are cleanly integrated with Open Source projects as well educating and encourage them to commit development resources to these projects.
* Providing feedback from an Operators perspective to various boards and developers.
* Playing “Johnny Appleseed” helping people set up OpenStack user groups throughout the Nation

I am doing what I can as an individual member of the OpenStack Foundation, as well as a leader in my own business to make this happen.
