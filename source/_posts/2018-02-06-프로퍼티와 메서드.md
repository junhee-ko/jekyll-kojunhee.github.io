## Properties

- Properties associate values with a particular class, structure, or enumeration. 
	- Stored properties store constant and variable values as part of an instance. Stored properties are provided only by classes and structures.
	- computed properties calculate (rather than store) a value. Computed properties are provided by classes, structures, and enumerations. 

## Methods

- Methods are functions that are associated with a particular type. 
- Classes, structures, and enumerations can all define instance methods, 
	- which encapsulate specific tasks and functionality for working with an instance of a given type. - Classes, structures, and enumerations can also define type methods, 
	- which are associated with the type itself. Type methods are similar to class methods in Objective-C.

- Instance methods are functions 
- that belong to instances of a particular class, structure, or enumeration. 

```
class Counter {
    var count = 0
    func increment() {
        count += 1
    }
    func increment(by amount: Int) {
        count += amount
    }
    func reset() {
        count = 0
    }
}
```

- The Counter class defines three instance methods:

```
increment() increments the counter by 1.
increment(by: Int) increments the counter by a specified integer amount.
reset() resets the counter to zero.
```

- can also define methods that are called on the type itself. These kinds of methods are called type methods
- You indicate type methods by writing the static keyword before the method’s func keyword. 
- Classes may also use the class keyword to allow subclasses to override the superclass’s implementation of that method

```
struct LevelTracker {
    static var highestUnlockedLevel = 1
    var currentLevel = 1
    
    static func unlock(_ level: Int) {
        if level > highestUnlockedLevel { highestUnlockedLevel = level }
    }
    
    static func isUnlocked(_ level: Int) -> Bool {
        return level <= highestUnlockedLevel
    }
    
    @discardableResult
    mutating func advance(to level: Int) -> Bool {
        if LevelTracker.isUnlocked(level) {
            currentLevel = level
            return true
        } else {
            return false
        }
    }
}
```
